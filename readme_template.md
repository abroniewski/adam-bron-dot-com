# Project Name

**One-line summary.**  
What this project does, who it’s for, and why it exists — in one clear sentence.

## The Problem

Describe the real-world problem this project addresses.

Focus on:
- What was broken or unclear
- Why existing tools or approaches weren’t sufficient
- The decision or workflow this unblocked

Keep this human and concrete.

## The Approach

How the system works at a high level.

- **Inputs:**  
  What data, signals, or user actions this consumes

- **Processing:**  
  The core logic, modelling, or intelligence applied  
  (graphs, analytics, LLMs, automation, etc.)

- **Outputs:**  
  What the user or system gets as a result

Avoid implementation details here.

## What Makes This Different

Why this exists instead of using:
- off-the-shelf tools
- a dashboard
- a generic AI chatbot
- a simpler script

Call out the key design decisions or trade-offs.

## Demo

Add one or more:
- Screenshot
- GIF
- Short video
- Live demo link

This is often the fastest way for someone to “get it”.

## Value Delivered

What changed as a result of this project.

Examples:
- Time saved
- Errors reduced
- Decisions accelerated
- New capability unlocked

Estimates are fine if clearly stated.

## Scope & Status

- **Project type:** PoC / Demo / Internal Tool / Production
- **Current state:** Actively used / Archived / Experimental
- **Limitations:** What this does *not* try to solve

This sets expectations and signals maturity.

## Who This Is For

The primary audience for this project.

Examples:
- Consultants
- Ops teams
- Product leads
- Researchers
- Founders

## Key Features

- One more, if needed

Avoid long lists.

## Getting Started

### How to use this in practice

- **PoC / demo repos:**  
  Use sections down to *Scope & Status*. Everything after is optional.

- **Production or reusable tools:**  
  Include Getting Started, Usage, and Testing.

- **Research repos:**  
  Emphasise *Problem*, *Approach*, and *Related Work*. Minimise setup.
