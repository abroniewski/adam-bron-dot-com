# Action Items
To complete by Jan 27
@Adam to understand when work with Vanderlande would end.
@Adam Check if can attend meeting Feb17 to start?
@Adam confirm Feb20 start date.

# Intros
**Robbert Z** - mechanical engineering background, MSc mech Engg in Delft, Accenture (11.5yrs), enjoys development (initially doing work in free time until had child). Recruited to Vanderlande after shifting from post Accenture role. Currently data architecture.

Focusing on process automation for warehouse. Main developers.Lots of help from Bart Hompus (sp?). Started implementing for warehouse in Albert Hejn, but project was put on hold. Robert is now joining Hilda’s team for process optimization for airports.

**Hilda** - BSc in india (software), Phillips for 4yrs, team building prototypes (healthcare analytics), lots of interest in data science. Did masters in TU/e specialization Data Science. Wanted to do PhD, collaboration between TU/e and Vanderlande. After 1 year, wanted to move from the deep tech and into Vanderlande as data science. Then product owner. At the time it was process mining and logistics. Lots of PhDs and masters students working in materials handling, but also wanted to understand the process an mining the process for information. Warehouse started with graphs in warehouses, Vanderlande developed graphs for internal use.

How do we build the product, where does it go, and how it evloves

# Project Proposal

Two major aspects:

1.  For airports, what use case most benefits from using knowledge graphs. On daily operation basis as well as from architects that are using strategy.
-   Specifically looking at airport level instead of baggage level. Future outlook.
-   Looking to understand the full context that might impact baggage handling 
2.  Technical part - extending knowledge graph with the elements of (1). Could start with an existing piece of work done in the past. Did not have a use case, or how to extend it. Use the knowledge graph that is built that can be used to discover or predict.

Warehouse background - Robbert -> Might be challenging scope, also depends on the availability of data. Will need to limit ourselves to a scope where the data already exists.
-  Warehouse defined epics based on use cases. Spoke to process engineers to build understanding of the domain to understand what questions they had that cannot be answered with the tools they already had. Vanderlande had a high bar to reach to add value. All their charts were implemented with Splunk.
-  Driving questions developed based on input from process engineers. These questions helped guide the development of the knowledge graph structure so that the question can be answered. It could be that the answer doesn’t provide huge value or that they find there isn’t a correlation.
-  Process engineer always has a “follow up” question. The easier it is to answer the “next question” the better. That would be the ultimate knowledge graph.

Will involve a PM that is looking at something that we can fall back to so that we don’t get caught without a path forward.

MOD programming - pair programming with the entire team, person behind the keyboard switches every few minutes, person typing doesn’t think, people watching do ideating. Robbert introduced this, and wants to create an open environment

No other master’s students in process mining department, but there are other students in different departments as well.

Start Feb20, defend thesis Aug.

Vanderlande employee with all freedom to talk to everyone

Friday afternoons to checkin on progress with Dirk + others
In office on Wednesday.

Hilda is in the office Monday/Tuesday.
