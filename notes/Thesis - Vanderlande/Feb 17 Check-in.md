1 - Clarity for Structure
2 - Next Steps
3 - Getting Started

Formally required to write a graduation plan + scope description, Dirk, Robert, Hilda on the plan. 1 page description for the scope of the project.

Scope
- Event System Knowledge Graph has been built for warehouse. Robert was involved in this.
- Internship work was done with London Heathrow to build knowledge graph
- This was all coming from the bottom, now the question is to connect to the top. Instead of connecting to the 
- Top down connection is from a process level. What is the airport doing, how does it work and what can be done? Not sure exactly what data we have available to us.
- Object, Element, Material and maybe section has been modeled, not really anything on the zone level and above.
- Want to look down from airport level to see if we can connect into something that exists. When we look from the top to model, we can simplify the work as we may not need to model everything on the bottom level.
- expectations: 2 months to familiarize with domain, understanding the site, people, interests, KPI, and zooming in on use case, data availability. Need to find a way to make everything fit.
GOAL: specific dataset that we know can be made available by the airport + idea of what we can do with it (what question to answer)
- then 2 months of engineering, building knowledge graph to help analyze use case. Will need to have a stakeholder that can help interpret my results
- At 4 month mark we will have concrete, rough idea. Next it will be to actually cleanup, finalize and write the thesis.
- looking for the use case, we will need to go about this systematically. Need a methodology to analyze the use cases, structure the decision process, identify why there is value in something. To some extent the decision may be opportunity driven, to be able to complete the thesis work.
- without use case, becomes difficult to validate the work. 
- finding the case needs to be rigorous, and well documented. The whole idea of finding a use case should be part of what I'm providing as novel in my thesis
- high level process mining is not something that is done. We don't just want to process mining on high level, we want this to be connected to the lower level operations.

Process at high level connected to each other with impact show on low level process.

Not 100% clear what this will look like in the end.

Connecting the top and bottom in a meaningful way is the important part.

Approach is still to use event knowledge graphs to model this behavior, but, not sure how well the two levels connect, and what is necessary to realize this connection in the graphs. Will we need to make lots of contortions to make things fit? It might be technically difficult...

Explicit element is to find out whether or not it makes sense to do this with graphs. Should we invest in this further? Do we have a mature enough technology (Neo4j + EVG) to invest further into this.

Scope does not include the pipeline to connect the data interface, does not include streaming data. We are doing static and historic analysis. Moving into predictive activities is really dependent on how straightforward the modeling activity is and what the Vanderlande SMEs are looking for or needing.


Site will either be Heathrow or Istanbul (likely Heathrow). I will be looking to talk to people and looking to understand things at a generalizable level (not necessarily airport specific).

NEXT MEETING: what data is useful, available. Lower level data we have and we can play with. Higher level data we haven't seen and played with.

Data location??

Co-supervisor between Hilda/Robert

There are standards for the kinds of data of how information is managed

TASK: What is generalizable? Identify things that are standard. Certain things will not be possible to implement, but would be spoken to as "this would be done here".

Airport data is also being sent 

How does the baggage handling system impact the airport, but also what other things are going on at the airport that can be explored that might be impacting things.

Expected to be working very closely with architects off the process.

Struggles:
- Time zone information, time stamps
- Identifiers
- Data quality (high, but remains an issue)
- Figuring out how to fix a problem once we know what it is -> Keep everyone informed about the data and what is working or not
- Lots of conflicting interests are added by different stakeholders -> Connect with Vi about her experiences. She figured out how to make graphs work for top management.
- In the office interacting gets a lot of information, things move slowly when moving
- Will be difficult to finish things on time. Last 6 weeks will be crunch time, lots of work. Can book it now.
- Anna is also BDMA student and has gone through this -> talk to her.
- Will be difficult to make things generalizable and move out of concrete level.
- Takes a long time to properly define the scope. This will be annoying.

Expectations for Weekly Meetings:
-Agenda/ structure
-What questions do I need answers
-What do I need feedback on to move on next week
-Include structure/ documentation that is a collection of things, at some point ill be asked to put presentation together
- visualizations will be good and helpful
-data talks, show data, concrete records (not just schema)
-short summary of what was discussed in previous weeks

Include all data and info in the Vanderlande repository, and include good documentation.

7th floor, behind MF15, there are desks that I can use and other masters students sitting there. Through the room booking system.
