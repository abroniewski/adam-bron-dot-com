## Proof of Concept - Feature List Questions

1. Do patients want help keeping track of drugs? Are they currently keeping track of them?
2. Do patients forget to get their refills on time? Are they having to visit the pharmacy more than once in a month for refills?
3. Are patients spending time planning their drug pickup logistics (e.g. which pharmacy they are picking up from)?
4. Do patients lookup drug information? Is there benefit that can be provided to patient by having drug info easy to access?
5. Are pharmacist able to provide value to patients if they have access to drug history? Is this value that is recognised by the patient?
6. Can condition changes during drug usage be leveraged by a healthcare team? Change or adapt a course of action? Can it be used by other research organisations?
7. Do pharmacies spend a lot of time updating netMed with drug prescriptions? Is this automated? What impact exists when the prescriptions are out of date? Is there benefit to urgent care centres when unknown patients visit?
