## Proactive

- Be aware of instant gratification. Do not "chase" an inebriated feeling. If tipsy, slow down.
    - Volume limit - 52 mL alcohol (3 standard drinks, 2 tall /473mL beers, 2 2oz drinks, 3 1.5oz drinks)
    - Shots - Avoid. Is the shot being fuelled by peer pressure or chasing feeling?
- Maintain healthy habits and coping mechanisms. Do not make drinking habitual or unconscious.
    - Frequency limit - No more than two days a week
- Build self-confidence and self-trust. Maintain accountability to myself with Sarah and friends acting as a checkpoint.
    - Communicate with Sarah if I am being sneaky, looking for loopholes, or keeping secrets. If so call it out with a friend or Sarah.
    - If a change to the plan is needed, document it and share it with Sarah.
- Develop proactive safety plans to catch myself if struggling.
    - Attend 12-step meetings to familiarize myself with the location and people.
    - Include alcohol in relationship check-ins.

## REACTIVE

- Talk to friends or Sarah about what happened
- Take an abstinence break (e.g., 1 week no alcohol)
- Journal and reflect on what happened, feelings, and desires moving ahead
- Attend a 12-step meeting
- Adjust your proactive safety plan accordingly (i.e., define and uphold new boundaries with myself)
