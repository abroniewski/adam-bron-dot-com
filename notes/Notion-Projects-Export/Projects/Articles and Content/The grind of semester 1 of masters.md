# The grind of semester 1 of masters

In my first semester at ULB, I had to pump myself up every single morning. It felt like I was going into another day of battle. There was so much new information and change from my past life. I left my home, friends and family, and was consistently beyond the limit of my understanding. Being 100% focused during class was the only way to just barely understand.

There were days (and nights) that I was pushing to understand or get something done and I felt like I had absolutely nothing to show for it afterwards. For me, it was a grind. Every. Single. Day. It seemed like I had a nice hard cry weekly. But it was quick, cause I had to get to class :eyeroll. I tried to remind myself that pain is temporary.

I shared my struggles with other BDMA students and found out I wasn't alone. Not everyone was struggling, but I wasn't alone. Outside of school, people would invite everyone to meetup for some events, or travel somewhere. I joined even if things were "too busy". It reminded me that school is a small slice of life, and that I MUST do other things.

The memories I cherish the most of my ULB time are the fun (non-school) times spent with my new BDMA family. It was also so cool that we all came from around the world to this city called Brussels to sit in a little study room together discussing classification methods and query optimization. How wild is that? The semester ended, way faster than I thought possible.
