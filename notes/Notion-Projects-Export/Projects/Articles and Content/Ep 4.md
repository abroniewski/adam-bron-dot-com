## thinking makes it so

I’ve been reading “The Obstacle is the Way” by Ryan Holiday, a book that breaks down stoic philosophies and how they can be applied to our daily lives. I’m surprised by how similar stoic and zen philosophies are. One of my most important pillars of life perspective gained from Zen is that no event in life is objectively “good” or “bad”, events are simply events. It is our interpretation of the events that gives the event meaning; it is up to us to decide if it is “good” or “bad”. I blindly accepted this tenant one day to test it out and see if it would work, and in all honesty, it has created and immense amount of relief from worries that I never needed to have!

My most clear example of this tactic working was when I got some… less than favourable feedback from my manager in my first year out of school. I was told that I was putting effort towards to wrong things and that my manager wasn’t even sure what I was doing with my time! This absolutely rocked me. I thought I was doing a teller job, all of my colleagues and stakeholders were happy with me… so it must’ve been my manager that was wrong! After a weekend of fuming and being certain my manager was in the wrong, I decided to flip the situation around and ask myself how I would react if it were all 100% true? This immediately gave calmed me. I started looking for ways in which my beheviour aligned with what my manager saw, and could instantly pick out ways in which I was NOT being effective with my time. The feedback I received transformed from critisicism and a personal attack, to feedback and an opportunity for growth.

I came away from the experience humbled, and driven. I had gaps in my work style that a colleague was gracious enough to share with me. I took the feedback, built a plan, became viciously transparent with my work, and course corrected. In my early career, it was an absolute blessing and I am thankful for the Zen teaching that his situation was not inherently bad. It was my responsibility to give it meaning, and (after 3 days) I decided to make it a good thing.

A little bit of research helped me find a couple different ways to say this same thing. Chris Prentiss’ “Zen and the Art of Happiness”, Shakespeare in “Hamlet”, and Markus Aurelius in “Meditations” all say it very well:

“The Universe doesn’t make mistakes.Everything is happening just as it should. It’s only our perception of difficulties that causes us the distress and the difficulty we experience. Not only that, but when we label events as ' bad,' we fail to perceive the benefit that is waiting for us.”

*There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so*.

“All is as thinking makes it so” or “Everything is what you judge it to be.”

**Cool Gear
keep your Calm**I started using the Calm meditation app in early December and have been loving the simplicity, messages, and effectiveness. What I like about the app is that it has a new 10 minute meditation every day with a different message, it provides a variety of practice styles (from focusing on the breath, to body awareness and sound), and has a check in feature. I complete a “How are you feeling?” check-in in the morning, which is a super easy, stress free opportunity to journal for 30s and then do a 10 minute mediation. In the evening, a complete a gratitudes checking (3 things I’m grateful for) and do the “daily trip” which is more of a learning or how-to session. I’ve also gotten into sleep stories. Nothing beats drifting to sleep while listening to Matthew McConaughey’s smooth voice…. I have yet to find out how any story ends!subscribe here [link]
