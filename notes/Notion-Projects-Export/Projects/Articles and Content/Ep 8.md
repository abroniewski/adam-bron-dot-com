## Creating a Support Group and Safety Net

It all started with a chance encounter and discussion in the hallway outside of class during a midway break. "I have no idea what's going on. I'm just stepping outside to take a break to breath". This struck me. I really didn't expect it. I didn't realize that other people might be feeling lost or confused in the classes. I assumed this stuff was all easy for them because they had computer science backgrounds. But maybe not....

### The First Steps - Understand the problem

I started asking more people how they are feeling. Are they overwhelmed? Comfortable? Is the content familiar? Brand new? I started to gather more information and anecdotes in one-on-one discussions about how people are really feeling and what they might be struggling with. I felt a responsibility for the others in the program. After all, we are in this master's together for the next 2 years. My classmates are family now.

### Going Deeper - What are the Right Questions to Ask?

I started by reaching out to program coordinator for support and to brainstorm some ideas. I was thinking they must see this type of shock with every year of students that pass through. I also started talking about what I was seeing and asking for suggestions from others. Friends and mentors really stepped up to ask the right questions and help me pin-point what can be done to help support the group

### Looking at the Data - Defining the Scope

With guidance and coaching from others, I asked some more questions and was able to better define some of the sources of and issues causing the other students to feel anxiety. What it boiled down to (in my understanding) was:

- ESL + translation time
- personal situation - homesickness, family, other issues
- environment - weather change, culture changes
- content covered
    - Ideas on what can be done
        - Narcotics Anonymous - "hello my name is Adam and I am struggling with courses"
            - Opportunity for people to share feelings and connect with others
        - study group - focused on learning content
        - social meetings - coffee or tea to vent/cry/laugh
        - Setup WhatsApp group for info sharing
    - Risks to me
        - Time - how much time or effort am I willing to put into it? What am I saying "No" to by saying "Yes" to this?
        - Codependence - taking on saviour mentality for an ego or confidence boost.
    - Risks to others
        - Belittling people or making them feel less then
        - Creating a rift in the group
        - Excluding people that also feel lost but are unaware of group existing
        - Creating a group the larger program is unaware of
        - How to determine who is in? "How lost are you feeling"?
- Solution
    - WhatsApp group "WTF" -> outlet for people to share frustrations and jokes. Emotional connection to feel like they're not alone
    - Study Hall
        - Phase 1 - Longer Sessions to review all course material from beginning to wherever we get
        - Phase 2 - Catchup + keep up
        - Phase 3 - Keep up
    - Transition to 1 person teaching summary + questions with 1 person time keeping

# Upcoming Focus

## Lower Quality

- Pursuing 100% quality (personal expectations or otherwise) has diminishing returns
- Time is being eaten up by the last 20% of quality instead of allowing to cover more items
- Focusing on letting go of things that are not necessary
    - Mark them down in a backlog (acknowledgment)
    - Ask myself - what is minimum requirement to get this done?
    - Schedule future time to get back to things

# Learning

## Lowest Level Performance Aggregates Up

- In database, learning about low level detail tasks work under the hood
- When there are millions of transactions, these inefficiencies and issues can aggregate up into large problems
- The same goes for small efficiency gains and improvements
- Victor - When starting new project, takes time to setup shortcuts, work environment, etc.
    - small input of time upfront that multiplies out
- Where is the line between capital investment today vs long term efficiency of tomorrow?
    - When do we complete a task vs choosing to leave it alone (see 80% quality)?
