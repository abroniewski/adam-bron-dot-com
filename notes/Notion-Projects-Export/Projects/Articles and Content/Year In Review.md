# Script - Year in Review

## Why?

1. To reflect on what I’ve done over the last year
2. Confirm or set direction by course correcting if necessary

## How?

1. Look through my calendar and photo album for events I’ve participated in.
    1. helps jog memory
2. Identify events, projects, actions, activities, feelings, things that didn’t happen, people met... whatever comes to mind
3. These all go into a more of and less of bucket
4. Identify trends in these buckets, and find ways to generalize the more and less of.
5. Reflect on my currently described “life values”. Are they still correct?
6. Given the trends I identified, what types of ways can I manifest these values in my current context (today)?
    1. Incorporating the trends makes it easy to stack existing activities into my life. These are things I was already doing, I am just looking to give them more of a “why?”
7. NEW - What skills do I want to learn?
    1. Incremental improvements instead of trying to achieve some arbitrary goal.
    2. Focus on process not outcome
