# Summary

So... how's the last year been? Amazing! There has been lots of technical learning, cultural exchange working with people from around the world, exciting trips and travel, and personal development.

I'm right in the middle of final exams and delivering all my project work. So I swing between feeling focused, frustrated, relaxed, and grateful.

It's been an unreal adventure so far and I'm looking forward to some time off, and a 1-month internship with MobilityDB developing data pipelines to process and analyze public transport and flight datasets.

# Year 1 Complete

I finished the first year of my program! I hate to use a cliché like “it’s been an incredible journey”, but, well, it’e been wild. There has been lots of technical learning, cultural exchange working with people from around the world, exciting trips and travel, and personal development.

# Comfortable Getting Technical

The most significant moment for me was in the middle of exam period semester 2, when I had submitted my last project and realized that I was comfortable architecting, coding, and deploying projects all on my own. Up to this point, I had a fear of “getting too technical”. I didn’t want to go into a more technical role at work because I might get stuck doing work I didn’t like… I realize now technical work requires just as much collaboration, soft skills, creativity and problem solving as other work I’ve done. It just has a different “flavor”.

Honestly, the moment crept up on me. I didn’t even realize I was doing technical work until I had completed everything. Click here for a 1min clip of “the moment”.

# Travel

I did a lot of it! I’ve been so fortunate to visit with my brother’s family in London several times, I saw my parents when they visited here and I’m on my way now to the Netherlands where my sister and her family are visiting! Outside of that, there have been lots of day-trips around Belgium, day-trips around Spain, a visit with friends from Canada in Girona and Valencia, trips to Majorca and Minorca, visits with Sarah in Dubai and Istanbul, quarantine in Bologna, Italy, a weekend in Athens and some day-trips to the Netherlands.

# Comforts of Home

It’s been really special to see friends from Canada. To have familiar cultural norms and language, and to be with people that have known me for more than 12 months is a really special moment. To be away from familiar norms and people that know me well is not something I realized would be so impactful… So if you’re going to be anywhere in Europe, let me know!

# Student Lifestyle

Being a student has been… different. Having full autonomy over my work and schedule is great! Until I realized I’m a perfectionist and my work never seems to meet my expectations. I also can’t negotiate deadlines (”I’ll have to get to that final-exam next week”??) and getting feedback on the direction I’m taking with a deliverable is a subtle art (”would you like to see this section in my report? how are you evaluating me?”).

The budgeting side of things has had it’s ups and downs as I’m living off of savings for 2-years. Planning ahead has helped a ton, because there are seperate savings accounts for vacation with Sarah, independent travel adventures, and day-to-day living. It’s still been a tough transition from salaried employee that can buy coffee for others, to having to say no to getting coffee out (at least not all the time). But as of today, it’s become a fun game to keep my daily spending where it belongs. Budgeting apps have certainly been helpful!

Living with less in general has been awesome. It’s liberating to have very few possessions, and only the ones that matter. I like living in small houses or apartments because they are easy to keep clean and tidy. I definitely think living with less, being creative to make things happen and buying used goods more often is a lifestyle that will stick with me.

# Bikes, Hikes and Relationships

I **LOVE** biking. I mean I really love it so much. I recently got a folding bike I’ve been drooling over for the last year from a company called Brompton. They look slick, fold down tiny, and are quite light. They are all hand built out of England. It makes travel around the city and by train super pleasant!

I also love nature and forests. I’m missing how easy it is to access lots of amazing hikes and natural areas from Calgary. But… it’s quite easy to take a train to get to trail heads here, I just haven’t really figured the system out.

Mining relationships across time-zones is really tough. End of day Europe time is the best for calling home, but sometimes you’re just tired and drained and don’t want to. It’s been challenging finding a way to make things work. To be honest, relationships are shifting and I think my expectations of what my past relationships looked like needs to adapt. It doesn’t mean they are worse for it, just… different. Voice messages and video messages seem to help, but I don’t have it figured out yet.

Everything with Sarah has been going great though! It feels like we are both really able to thrive in our current solo adventures, and we still have time together throughout the year. We dream together and plan all sorts of things for the coming years. But… coming together and then seperating again **SUCKS.** Every. Single. Time. It’s painful to leave. It helps to know we have an end-game and neither of us would change things, but it’s still hard.

# Next Up…?

I’m currently doing a 1-month internship in Brussels developing business intelligence dashboards for mobility data (i.e. things that move in space and time). It’s super relaxing to finish work, cook a nice dinner, and sit outside with a forest view. I’m savoring the calm before the storm!

In September I will start semester 3 at TU/e in Eindhoven, NL. The specialization I choose is Business Process Management, which, as I understand it, is essentially mining and analyzing data generated from a process being followed to help make decisions and predictions.
