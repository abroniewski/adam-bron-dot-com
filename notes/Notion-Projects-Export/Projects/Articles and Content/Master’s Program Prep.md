School Prep
    ◦ DataCamp online program
        ▪ Follow predevelopped course curriculum. helped me avoid distractions and "shiny objects"
        ▪ Provided good basis of concepts and terminology, feeling confident to get started in program knowing it will still be challenging
    ◦ Review course content ahead of time. Starts to prime my mind for key topics
    ◦ Setup evernote and file system -> remove admin tasks as barrier.
