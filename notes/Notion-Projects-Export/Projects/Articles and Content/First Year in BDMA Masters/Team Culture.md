# Team Culture

## Open Learning

During semester 1 I worked a lot to setup study groups and make collaboration and knowledge sharing a norm. A lot of people were coming from very different academic backgrounds, some of which encouraged academic competition. I shared all my work openly, and made time to help others with their learning and projects.

During final exams, we made use of MS Teams to post questions and answers as everyone studied. Personally, I studied with a small group of people where we had time bound personal reviews followed by group discussions and explanations. This solidified the concepts as it forced everyone to know a topic well enough to explain it.

I setup review sessions for each exam to go through all the topics beginning to end. A cool learning for me was to get feedback in the middle of the reviews to change the format to something that would continue to be useful for others. We also shared the leadership of different topics, giving everyone the opportunity to participate. By the end, the sessions were more of a facilitated Q&A session.
