# Budgeting

I may have been a bit too optimistic about what kind of budget I can maintain while living as a student. Transitioning to a student lifestyle was certainly jarring. The budget has evolved from its original form to include a subset of money that I use just for small weekend trips and travel around Europe, and we are redoing things to establish a new baseline. Cutting into contingency every month is not the right way!

There were also some unexpected regular costs, like fees for visas, and the cost of medication for ADHD (it's not covered here, and its expensive).

But it's all part of the process and thankfully, Sarah and I have contingency built on contingency built on planning, so it's just a matter of rebalancing a couple things and getting back on track!
