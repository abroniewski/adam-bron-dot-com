# Time Management

## Boundaries

School was sucking up every minute of my time. No matter how much time I gave, it never seemed to be enough. In Semester 1, I had several weeks where I would be up till 3am or 4am and then wake up at 7am to get started again. Things go unreasonable.

In semester 2, I tried setting a strict "no school after 8:30pm" rule. So no matter where I was or what I was doing, I stopped everything. I kept waiting for the negative consequences to hit... Obviously I'd start falling behind on work right?

I was ready to make use of the negative consequences as feedback to work smarter or change where I focused time. But the other side of things never happened. Projects still got done, things were still submitted. The level of quality may have dropped a bit (i.e. less unnecessary fretting and perfection over the type font and cover page), but everything was still getting done.

I've been working on the idea that the quality of my work is not a reflection of my worth as a person. This particular boundary has been helpful to get my work pushed out and get feedback on what people are really looking for. If I'm getting good feedback on my "lower quality" than obviously the things I was focusing on were not that important to the recipients!

## Healthy Lifestyle

In semester 2, I made a couple more tweaks to lifestyle to keep things balanced. There were 3 simple rules to follow:

1) Daily exercise

2) Small routine changes

3) Weekend plans

I get into the gym for a super quick (max 20min) workout. There are countless studies about the positive impact this has on all the things, my intent was that it would help me feel good (great hormone and endorphine release), and help keep energy levels high (during the day and better quality sleep)

For routine changes, I would take a slightly different path to school, or maybe go to the cafeteria before class to do some duolingo... any small little change to the routine to keep things fresh

I started saying "yes" to activities, events, and trips so that I would have something to look forward to. This really helped to break the time up and keep the weeks from blending into each other.
