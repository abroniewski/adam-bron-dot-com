## Theory

Asking questions continues to feel like a super power. I prep all my profs at the beginning of the semester about my background and that I will be asking LOTS of questions. On the whole, I am sticking with the commitment I made in my application. The other students appreciate my questions as well, and, as a group, we are all profiting from a more dynamic and engaging learning experience during class.

## Technical

With coding, the way to go is to just dive in and start trying things. Having a bit of a "scratchpad" to test small snippets of code to make sure its acting as expected has been a great addition to the process. Understanding how to error check and debug has been an improvement.

I do keep running into issues that are caused by some fundamental misunderstanding or lack of knowledge due to my background. Every now and then I will sit down with someone and get a full crash course in a topic (like how memory works, or different data structures).

- First 80% of time is frustrating. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, where to find it. It's hard to understand what I am doing. There are no indicators of progress or success.
- Suddenly things start to click and fall into place.
