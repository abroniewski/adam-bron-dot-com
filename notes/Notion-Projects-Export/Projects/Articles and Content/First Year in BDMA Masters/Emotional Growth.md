# Emotional Growth

## Self-worth

The concept of my self-worth being tied up in the feedback and judgment of others has really come to the forefront. The impact of the grades I would get back was unreasonable. I don't want to have so much of how I feel about myself tied up in what others think. This pushed a lot of perfectionism in my reports and projects where I was going way overboard with how much time I would put into school.

It also meant I wasn't putting any value on my personal experiences like visiting new places, connecting with people or taking care of myself and relaxing.

## Trust

I'm starting to recognize how much weight I put into how people communicate their ideas and how much experience someone has before I trust alternative opinions. If someone speaks with confidence and I know they have past experience on a topic, I will give them more trust to guide how I do things. I'd like to have a more objective approach and be more open-minded. I tend to move to control when I don't trust others, and that does not mean that my approach will work better!

## Frustration with Unknown

When I start working with a new technology or system, I noticed I very quickly feel overwhelmed, anxious and frustrated. Thinking back to my time in professional settings, this is likely when I would procrastinate working on something and move towards the easier tasks.

I'm working now to be aware of the physical feelings associated with this frustration (tightness in my chest and jaw), remind myself that I have always been able to figure it out in the past, and try to break the learning down into smaller bit sized tasks to give a bit more structure to things.
