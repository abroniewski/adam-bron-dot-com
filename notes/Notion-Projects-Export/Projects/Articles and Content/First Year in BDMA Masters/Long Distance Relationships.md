# Long Distance Relationships

My existing relationships suffered. I had a naive idea that I could put all my relationships "on-hold" for 2 years while I focus on school, and pick up where we left off after that. This worked great for the first couple of months. I didn't have to worry about the time change, scheduling moments to catchup. I was able to stay fully engaged in my present moment.

But, after a little while, it sucked. The new relationships I was making didn't have the depth, trust and history I needed. I started to pick things back up a bit more in semester 2, but to be honest, staying in touch with people is not my strong point. It's like I'm a 2 year old playing peek-a-boo. As soon as I don't see someone in front of me, they stop existing.

I discovered this is a common occurrence in people with ADHD, so that was at least a bit comforting to know, but it did not solve any of the problems. I still need to work at this and stay on top of my checkins with people. Scheduling the time in my calendar seems to work well... as long as a remember to schedule the time!
