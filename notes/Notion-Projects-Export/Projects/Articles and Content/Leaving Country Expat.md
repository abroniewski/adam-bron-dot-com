Moving Out
    ◦ Detailed list of all things
        ▪ Object, pictures, potential price
        ▪ Public Google Folder or FB album
    ◦ Tracking things
        ▪ Who purchased, where posted
    ◦ FB Marketplace
        ▪ Setting slots of availability, buyer needs to meet me on my terms
        ▪ If price too low -> flooded by interest. lots of time invested in small items
    ◦ Seek out expat sites, people immigrating to country
    ◦ We connected with someone going through seperation. Had house, needed things
        ▪ Called her and provided a virtual "tour" of the house
        ▪ Tracked all objects, provided an "invoice" afterwards
    ◦ Ask if people are interested in other similar objects
    ◦ Did not anticipate time required for final clean
