Relationships
    ◦ Being helpful and sharing knowledge
        ▪ Hours of research and website browsing, extra 15min to document findings and share
        ▪ Created google doc to make it easier for program members to refer to (repeating questions)
    ◦ Am I robbing people of the opportunity to learn through struggle?
        ▪ Pulling back on some seemingly helpful things
        ▪ Asking people if they would like additional support instead of just doing it for them
    ◦ Being inclusive of everyone
        ▪ Trying to get all program participants involved in group activities
        ▪ Need to accept that not everyone may want to participate. Need to let go of control and desire of "one big happy family". Provide opportunity but cannot force people.
    ◦ Identifying Future Key Contacts
        ▪ Charlotte - program coordinator: Met for a walk just to say hi, thank her for efforts and get to know her
        ▪ Alex - Building admin: Will be living here for 5 months. Need to have good relationship in case of issues
            • Tried to meet in person as much as possible, followed up with detailed email to help keep track of things and document issues
            • Would meet just to chat and get to know each other (not only with issues)
            • Listened, empathized and seek to understand their context without an agenda to make my needs known
        ▪ Profs: Key to learning, research projects, potential jobs
    ◦ Euro/Asian split
        ▪ Different experience levels with travel.
        ▪ Some people leaving home or country for first time
        ▪ European influenced students seem more empowered to find events and go do things outside immediate environment.
        ▪ Working to bridge relationships and reach out individually.
