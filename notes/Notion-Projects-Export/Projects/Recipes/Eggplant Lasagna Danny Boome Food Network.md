### Directions

- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
- Arrange sliced eggplant in a single layer on 2 sheet pans. Brush on both sides using 3 tablespoons of oil and season with salt and pepper. [Roast](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/roast/index.html) the eggplant until it is soft and golden. Turn slices halfway through, about 25 minutes.
- Meanwhile, in a medium skillet add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the sliced mushrooms. Saute until soft for about 7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and chopped [thyme](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/thyme/index.html). Cook for another 2 minutes. Once the mushrooms are cooked remove and set aside to cool.
- In a large bowl add the ricotta, [eggs](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/eggs/index.html), 1/2 cup [Parmesan](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/parmesan/index.html), oregano, mushrooms, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Mix well. Brush an 8-inch baking dish with oil.
- Spread half of the marinara sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay 4 slices on top followed by the ricotta mixture. Lay another 4 slices of eggplant and finish with [marinara sauce](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/marinara-sauce/index.html). Top with the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Bake until golden brown, at 350 degrees, for 30 minutes.
- 

**Nona's Marinara Sauce:**

- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
- [Peel](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/peel/index.html) 5 [cloves garlic](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/garlic/index.html) and place them in a square of foil. Sprinkle the cloves with salt and pepper and [drizzle](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/drizzle/index.html) with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Wrap up the foil and place it directly on the oven rack. (Be sure that the foil packet is secure so no oil will leak out.) Roast the garlic until it's brown and tender, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool enough to touch and squeeze the garlic from the skins. Set aside.
- Saute [onions](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/onion/index.html) and carrots with the oil in a medium [saucepan](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/saucepan/index.html). Add tomato paste and stir well. This will cook off the [tomato paste](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/tomato-paste/index.html) and give a nice orangy color. Cook for about 10 minutes. When vegetables are softened add the roasted garlic, salt, pepper, basil, [oregano](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/oregano/index.html) and stir together until incorporated. Pour in the tomatoes. Fill the empty can with water and add it to the pan. Bring to a boil then lower the heat to a [simmer](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/simmer/index.html). Simmer for 1 hour, uncovered. Stir occasionally. Once sauce is ready carefully pour it into the [food processor](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/food-processor/index.html) and puree until smooth.
- 

**Tips:**

- Pour into ice [cube](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/cube/index.html) trays and freeze for future use. By putting them in ice cube trays then popping them out into a resealable bag you can control how much you want to use each time - easier to manage.
- Since [tomatoes](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/tomato/index.html) can be very acidic, using carrots and roasted garlic brings a sweetness to the marinara.
- Yield: 3 cups

**Your Rating:⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆POST REVIEWSort byJamie C.228 days ago⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆This was so good.  I added a bit of mozz on top.   I would cut the eggplant a bit smaller next time.

• 0⚑Day B.234 days ago⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆Another great example of American synchretism - appropriate something without understanding what it is, add or withdraw an ingredient and give it a new name (if possible, American something) that shows once again that you got no idea about anything.. That is eggplant moussaka of SE Europe, not "eggplant lasagna".Lasagna are the noodles. You can't have lasagna without lasagna noodles the same way you can't have mashed potatoes without potatoes.

• 0⚑bubblesss637 days ago⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆very good with some modifications-used a meat slicer to get thinner slices of eggplant, added mutz to the filling and on top, used my marinara sauce recipe - delicioso

• +1⚑CindyAustinTexGal727 days ago⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆Pour what into ice cubes trays?  The tip is not clear??  Make your own marinara.  Have to us large eggplants and slice thin or else you have to use more eggplants. Okay.

• 0⚑Gabrielle Bolton770 days ago⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆AMAZING-tasting recipe so I am giving it five stars. It has become a go-to for me. However you MUST make the marinara sauce ahead of time. Don't do it all at once or it will take you forever.

• +1⚑Trisha G.844 days ago⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆I enjoyed this recipe.  The ricotta mixture was really delicious.  I will use that in other lasagna recipes.  I also used two eggplants.  I divided the mixture between two 8x8 pans so I could freeze one.  I also added two layers of lasagna noodles, one on the first layer of sauce and the other in the middle, because I sliced my eggplant too thin.  I used sauce that I had already made from the tomatoes in my garden.  I will definitely make this again.

• 0⚑Guest849 days ago⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆This recipe was delicious, however time consuming. It also took me about two hours prep time. I used a 9x13 pan, there was a little extra sauce, however, I needed about two more eggplants to complete the layers. The sauce was very tasty I used more herbs and beef stock instead of water when refilling the tomato can.

• 1 Comment⚑jlgram123851 days ago⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆This recipe was delicious but was a pain in the neck.  It says 10 minutes prep time and 1 hour bake time but with dicing slicing vegetables, roasting garlic and eggplant, simmering sauce, pureeing and assembling it was easily 1 1/2 to 2 hours prep time.  Not only that, the recipe easily overwhelmed my 8x8 dish. (Guess my eggplants were bigger than his). Also, the marinara sauce doesn't fit in a large saucepan and I had to transfer the whole thing to a larger stockpot.   p.s. Bake time is only 30 minutes not an hour.  Please get the details right when you post a recipe!!
