# 5 November 2021 - Discussion with David Parker

## Where to find jobs or projects?

- Networking
- Coffee meetings with discussions about what is happening in industry and problems being dealt with
- What kind of work am I thinking to do?
    - Overflow where client doesn't have enough resources -> contract team to help?
    - Specialized team to complete something they couldn't do themselves?

## How to Structure?

- Making a large plan strategy vs implementation
- Come in for a 2 day offsite vs develop long term visions and plans
    - Complete some small tasks one at a time, let the info/ knowledge set in, then come back to complete next steps
- Combination of strategy and planning + implementation and farming work out

## The Pitch

- Engaged employees are at the hear of a good company
- Need to find a way take a business problem and look at how it can be culturally implemented
- What are the tangible, measurable metrics that can be used to measure the success of the endeavour?
- How do you measure the success of culture?

## How to kick things off

1. Network and Meet people
2. Get to know problems and industry
3. Talk with others about the problems
4. Maybe complete some overflow
5. While doing overflow, you can see some opportunities -> develop and deliver a free plan for that
