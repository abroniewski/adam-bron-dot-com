Follow up with profs after some sessions to go over issues they have
This will help me in discussions as well as with student focus

The learning will happen on its own. FOCUS ON THE STRUCTURE

Summarize instead of teaching back. The connections between the concepts are more important the concepts themselves. 

Glassary defines all words. 1 column included for context or how the connections fit. 

Iterate the structure omas needed. Don’t worry attendance. Focus on the 1000 fans

Bubdle.us -> mind mapping ideas and concepts to learn better. Works better than long from beginning to ending in book 

Repetition - add things that need repetition into meeting. If only 1 person, need to focus on the issue. 

If 1 person talking, 3 struggling, this is what I work to uncover. 

Each group comes up with 3 questions to pose another group to see if they understand the concept. 

Can package the question and system for future cohorts. Helps to think about it as a package that you can turn around and sell. 

How do I know this is delivering value? Will someone be willing to pay for this? Can someone else apply it easily? I’m trying to build a system to learn.
