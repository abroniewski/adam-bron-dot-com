# Project Management Techniques

- OKR
- AGILE
    - High level sprints planned ahead of time
    - week by week maybe 4 or 5 ahead → looking at resource availability
    - How do you stop halfway through the sprint if a need changes?
- SCRUM
- Kanban
    - backlog of items that get pulled whenever something is finished.
    - works better if there are changing needs
