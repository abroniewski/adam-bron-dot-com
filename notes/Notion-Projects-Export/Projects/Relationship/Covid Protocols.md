- Out for a walk
    - Hand sanitizer in and out of building
    - Keep distance while passing people
    - If you strike up convo, keep 2m apart
- Meeting with friends
    - If moving around, wear masks
    - If staying still and within 2m, wear masks
    - If staying still greater than 2m, no masks needed
    - Use sanitizer for hands
    - If accepting something from someone, treat it like it has covid
- Babies
    - No holding babies
- Dogs or animals
    - use sanitizer after petting

Before meeting with people, establish ground rules (masks, hand washing, 2m) so there are no surprises

Group meetings must be 10 or fewer people

If something changes and you are no longer able to follow rules, leave for a moment, collect your thoughts away from the situation, and see if there is a way to make things right. If not, leave.
