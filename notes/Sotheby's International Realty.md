implications 
- lots of time

### Situation (fact-finding, context)

You want to uncover how he currently works and what matters most:

- How are you currently sourcing, cleaning, and preparing the data for these market reports?
- What tools do you use today for data processing and visualisation?
- How do you decide what’s “localized enough” when reporting on micro-markets?
- Who are the main audiences for these reports—agents, buyers, investors, internal leadership?

### Problem (frustrations, inefficiencies)

You want him to voice the pain points, not you:

- What’s most time-consuming or frustrating about the current process?
- Do you ever run into limitations in scale—for example, if you wanted to produce 5x as many reports?
- Are there gaps in what clients or agents are asking for that you can’t currently provide?

### Implication (make the pain concrete, higher stakes)

Here you expand on the cost of doing nothing:

- If it stays manual, what does that limit in terms of timeliness, accuracy, or competitiveness?
- What happens if competitors start using AI-driven insights and can produce more granular reports faster?
- How does the current workload impact your ability to focus on higher-value tasks like strategy or client engagement?

### Need-Payoff (help him picture the benefit)

Instead of “I can sell you X,” you frame it as _what it would mean for him_:

- If the process could be automated, what would you do with the time saved?
- Would having AI-assisted micro-market analysis give your agents an edge with clients?
- If you could dynamically generate custom visualisations for a specific property or neighbourhood, how would that change your client conversations?
