Dear Eneco Hiring Team,  
  
I quit my job in the energy sector and left the country to redefine my purpose in creating a sustainable future. But that wasn’t the first time I veered from the expected path: I initially walked away from a mechanical engineering program when it became clear it was leading me toward Calgary’s oil and gas sector—an industry I wasn’t comfortable supporting. After a year of general studies, I returned with fresh perspective, completed my degree in Mechanical Engineering (Energy and Environment), and spent a semester abroad in China working on renewable energy projects. That international experience cemented my enthusiasm for collaborating across diverse cultures to drive meaningful change.  
  
I then joined TC Energy with the confidence that I could make a difference from within. Over eight years there, I served as a strategic project manager, root cause analysis specialist, and cultural change champion. I developed a prototype peer-to-peer energy trading platform through Avatar Innovations and volunteered with the NKA wind turbine project to bring clean power to developing nations. Eneco’s mission to achieve CO₂ neutrality by 2035 resonates with these experiences and my personal commitment to sustainability.  
  
At TC Energy, I delivered 16 projects over two years (totaling $28M) and oversaw 23 emergency response operations, coordinating teams of 30+ individuals including field staff, engineers, managers, and executives. I also spearheaded the design and rollout of a company-wide response process, securing sign-offs from 18 different teams, then managed annual training and updates. These experiences sharpened my ability to communicate complex information across audiences and ask genuine, curiosity-driven questions during root cause analysis investigations.  
  
Eager to harness data for greater impact, I pursued a Master’s in Big Data Management and Analytics. Without a formal computer science background, I tackled the steep learning curve head-on—ultimately finishing at the top of my class in three out of four semesters. Mastering ETL, query optimization, scalable data pipelines, and machine learning often required me to seek out knowledge from peers, engage deeply in group settings, and approach problems from a fresh angle. This dynamic not only accelerated my own understanding, but also elevated the collective perspective and skill sets of my entire cohort.  
  
After graduating, I founded a company to commercialize MobilityDB, a geospatial analytics engine. Multiple pivots later, I now run a data consultancy that helps clients reduce operational costs by 5–10%. One significant project for a tax auditing firm required me to quickly absorb an unfamiliar domain, financial regulations, yet I successfully designed an end-to-end analytics pipeline and an active-learning ML model, achieving a 93% accuracy rate with real-world validation. This blend of technical expertise, rapid domain adaptation, and business acumen has prepared me for high-impact challenges in dynamic environments. Yet I’m eager to tackle larger-scale issues, deepen my technical craft, and drive the energy transition forward.  
  
Although I don’t have direct experience in meteorology or numerical weather prediction, my proven ability to excel in unfamiliar domains—from computer science to tax auditing—equips me to ramp up quickly and thrive in new technical areas. Your ambition to transform short-term energy trading for wind and solar forecasting aligns perfectly with my passion for sustainability. I’m confident that my entrepreneurial mindset, proven project leadership, and deep analytics expertise would immediately support Eneco’s mission of delivering sustainable energy for everyone.  
  
I would appreciate a discussion to see if we would be a good fit for each other. Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to hearing from you soon.  
  
Sincerely,

Dear Eneco Hiring Team, 

I dropped out of my mechanical engineering program after the first semester of studies. 

I felt the course content was driving me towards a job in Calgary's oil and gas sector, which was something I didn't want to contribute to. After a year of general studies, I returned with a fresh perspective and completed my degree in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Energy and Environment. A semester abroad in China, dedicated to renewable energy projects, solidified my interest in collaborating with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds. I joined TC Energy, a North American oil and gas transmission company, with the confidence that I could drive change from within the company. I spent 8 years there in various roles which included working as a strategic project manager, root cause analysis investigation specialist, and cultural change champion. I was able to continue contributing to sustainable energy development through programs like the Avatar Innovations where I developed a prototype peer-to-peer energy trading platform, and volunteering with the NKA wind turbine development project to harness wind energy in developing nations. Eneco’s mission to achieve CO₂-neutrality by 2035 and bring “sustainable energy for everyone” resonates with my personal journey in the energy sector.

My experiences at TC Energy are where I sharpened my relationship building, communication, and planning skills. In my time there as a project manager, I delivered 16 projects over 2 years with a $28M value. As a Strategic Project Manager, I oversaw 23 emergency response operations, coordinating with teams of 30+ individuals spanning field staff, engineers, managers, and executives—an effort that demanded clear, adaptable communication. I also spearheaded the design and rollout of a company-wide response process, which required securing sign-offs from 18 different teams, followed by annual training and updates. These responsibilities cultivated my ability to translate complex information for a variety of audiences and to ask genuine, curiosity-driven questions during root cause analysis investigations.

I’ve learned that sometimes stepping off the expected path can open doors to more meaningful opportunities. I could see a huge potential in the data I used to inform corrective actions as part of the 19 root cause analysis investigations I completed at TC Energy, but I didn't have the expertise to fully exploit it. I decided to transition into a new career field and took on a masters in Big Data Management and Analytics. My lack of a formal education in computer science made this an especially challenging endeavour, but my natural curiosity helped me master the fundamentals while learning state-of-the art techniques in ETL, query optimization, data model design, scalable data pipeline architecture and machine learning algorithms. A highlight of my first year was working with my team made up of colleagues from Peru, Taiwan, Spain, and Pakistan to design and test different time series models (we chose Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, SARIMA) to forecast public transport arrival times in Brussels. My specialization in process mining at TU/e culminated in building an event knowledge graph that slashed investigation time from two hours to just 15 minutes while expanding analysis from 2 to over 200 locations.

After graduation, I leaned into my entrepreneurial side and founded a company to commercialize MobilityDB, a geospatial analytics engine. We've had several pivots, and I now find myself running a general data consultancy where I engage with clients to understand their pain points and build digital solutions that help them improve their bottom line, reducing operational costs by 5-10%. One major project for a tax auditing firm enabled me to design an end-to-end analytics pipeline and an active-learning ML model, achieving a 93% accuracy rate with real-world validation. This blend of theoretical knowledge and applied problem-solving has equipped me to handle high-impact analytical challenges in dynamic environments. I want to take on bigger problems with a more meaningful impact, and want to work with an established team where I can focus on technical implementation and master my craft.

I'm drawn to Eneco's values and excited about the prospect of applying my unique combination of technical skills, business acumen and entrepreneurial experience to use data, analytics, and AI to transform short-term energy trading for wind and solar forecasting. The chance to make a tangible contribution to society by helping accelerate the energy transition aligns with my values and passion for sustainability.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in energy, data science, and collaborative leadership can support Eneco’s mission of “sustainable energy for everyone.” I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Adam Broniewski
