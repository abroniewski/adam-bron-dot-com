	- card on right side. When the card is expanded, it shows relevant job opportunities the user can apply for. 
		1. Job opportunities will only be displayed if the job_seeker_profiles is populated with preferred_industries, location_preferences, and needs_visa_sponsorship
			1. If the minimum information is not yet gathered in the user profile, a prompt suggestion button will be displayed that says "Find relevant jobs". When the user clicks this button, it will send text into the main chatbox that says "Help me find my ideal job. Let's build my basic profile with my industry and locations preferences and visa sponsorship needs". 
		2. 3 job matches are shown as cards with basic information. There's a "Learn More" button on each card the user can click. When they click, a job posting card appears below the chat with all of the role details.
	- create an LLM bot that generates 3 job postings based on data from the user
		1. LLM is triggered as soon as the there is data populated in all 3 fields of the job_seeker_profiles for: preferred_industries, location_preferences, and needs_visa_sponsorship. When these 3 fields have values the LLM also runs if there is a change or update to any of these fields: preferred_industries, location_preferences, and needs_visa_sponsorship, target_job_roles, key_skills, soft_skills, certifications
		2. include all fields from the job_seeker_profiles as context into the prompt.
		3. Creates 3 jobs that cover a range of opportunities where there is a good match with information in the profile that exists, and a range of options for missing profile information. So the jobs are as different as they can possibly be, while still matching on all of the available profile info.
		4. LLM response is returned in a structured JSON object
