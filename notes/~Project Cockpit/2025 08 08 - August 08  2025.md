Huddly Demo
- turn MExit into customizable RAG LLM accessible via API call
- Use Zod to enforce all types as we will be moving across multiple internal services communicating via API and REST calls. 
- Decide how to manage auxiliary functions that were used to generate the RAG vector DB. where should these exist? With the RAG LLM? In their own service? They are together now, let’s keep it practical and not move something we don’t have to, but let’s make sure we are documenting things well and have good process and development hygiene in place. 
- Chatbot personality -> write a life summary/CV with memories and experiences that we want Huddly to have. We will also develop his personality, mannerisms, style, etc. so that they really feel like a real person to the user. 
- The users should all have a similar experience with the chatbot, but each experience should be personal. Huddly will need to remember key details about the user. This would be easiest done using an industry standard long term memory system of key information the user shares. We should take advantage of the best API coding structure and model that can manage the conversational context and stuff for us. Let’s off load the tech as much as possible. 
- Build a database with key information about the user as we come across. This will happen during conversations with the chatbot Huddly. We need to be scraping all file uploads, conversations, text, VMs etc. for data about the user the we can store in a structured database. This is the information we determine to be most essential in the context of growing a business to prepare for liquidation of assets (selling your shares or exiting your company). 
- Use the scoring system being used to generate readiness scores along with the information gathered through the questionnaire being fed by the website backend (schema drive UI). We will continue storing user data and information in this central database as it is already connected to the scoring system and the website, which is the technical core of the system. 
- Do a top to bottom analysis and audit on the website codebase. Implement Zod for all type safety. Review the current cursor rules being used. Summarize the codebase tech stack and any future adjustments or changes that need to be made to accommodate the technical vision. 
- Given how we are looking to use the system, future proof it by adjusting or adding things like Zod. We need to be careful not to refactor too so much that we start breaking things that work. It’s a fragile system.
