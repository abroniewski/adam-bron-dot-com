What is this document? It's a place to ground some questions and discussion points to get aligned on things that may have drifted living apart for an extended period of time. It's also a way to get on the same page as to how re-integration might look, and what we want our future to look like.

The idea is that we would both have clarity on:
1) Vision of the next 5 years
2) Needs of Sarah and Adam
3) Fears or hesitatations
4) Mutual understanding of managing those fears
5) Alignment on what is more and less important

## Mission and Purpose
Just to ground things, and cause of some of the books I've been reading, I wanted to setup and identify a mission and purpose that we can use and come back to as a team. One thing that I like is that idea that "my mission is set in my partners world. It must be clear the value, advantages and benefits I am providing". This is from business books, but I like this idea.

- [ ] What are 15-20 words that descirbe our shared values? (e.g. creativity, loyalty, faith, generosity, adventure, communication etc.)
- [ ] What are the top 4-5 core values from all of these?
With core values in mind, how would we answer the following:
- [ ] What do we see as our purpose?
- [ ] What do we want to be remembered by?
- [ ] What are we passionate about?
- [ ] What makes us feel the most fulfilled?
- [ ] What do we believe in?
With the core-values + previous questions, what is our purpose? Consider these questions to help: What do we want to accomplish? Who are we doing it for? How will we make their lives better?
**Purpose:** 

#### Adam's Mission and Purpose
I gave some thought to how I want to show up as a partner in our relationship. Here is the mission and purpose that I feel aligns with how I want to show up in our relationship:
	***To support Sarah in attaining her dreams, and maximize the fun and pleasure she experiences in daily life. I do this by maintaining a clear understanding of Sarah's worldview, plans and ideas so that I can and minimize the emotional friction along the way. I exercise my own mental and emotional health to maintain interdependence and show up authenticaly me.***
