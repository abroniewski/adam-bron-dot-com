I regret the words I said, and how they made you feel. I’m sorry.

**What did I do?**
-   Sarah shared her surprise at enjoying anal activities as much as she does
-   I shared a pang of jealousy, and said that I felt like I wanted her to “save some for me” and that I wanted to experience that exploration while it was still new for Sarah too.
-   Underlying fear was that her body would change with lots of activity
-   Previous to that, I also shared my experience with Marlene, and said that there was “more cushion for the pushin’” and said that her “vagina was a bit more loose” and that she’d “been around the block”

**Why did I say what I said?**
-   My intention with sharing things about Marlene was to be honest about how I felt about the relationship, to feel empowered and supported in my decisions. I shared about her vagina from a place of curiosity and interest about how different bodies can be.
-   My intention in sharing about the anal things with Sarah was to be honest about open relationship feelings that come up to stay aligned and receive reassurance.
-   With reflection: What I said was insensitive, rude, and judgmental. I didn’t reflect or consider the impact it might have on Sarah to say what I did, especially knowing some of the pre-existing sensitivities and just how vulnerable Sarah was being in sharing these things. I took it all for granted.
	-   Lacking filter and pre-processing: For that I am sorry.
-   I was concerned about the physical appearance of a part of Sarah’s body. There was a “personal preference” of how things might look, and I put my desires ahead of Sarah’s feelings and the safety and trust of our relationship.
-   More concerning: Underlying judgment that leads to the thoughts. This is concerning for me. I want to be able to observe and notice, without the judgment of something being good or bad. I want to appreciate differences without the need for pre-processing or filtering how I say things. I DO also want to filter because even if my message is coming from non-judgmental place in future, I want to be aware of how different people might received it.

**How did my words impact Sarah?**
-   Judgment of her body
-   Like the space between her and I was no longer safe for how our bodies looked and felt
-   Shame about the things she was trying and doing sexually
-   Uncertainty about how I would feel about her body as it changed with age and childbirth
-   Fear, insecurity, judgment, rejection, vulnerable, hurt, fragile, embarrassed
-   VOWS: 
	-   I will respect you as a person and as an equal; because we are partners and we always have each other's best interests at heart.
		-   My words led to you feeling disrespected.
	-   I will listen to you with compassion and speak with encouragement; because life can be hard, and I will support you as you pursue your goals and evolve.
		-   My words were selfish, and you did not feel encouraged by me
	-   I will create a home for you that will be a refuge; it will be full of love, laughter, and peace. 
		-   Our space did not feel safe for you to be yourself and share openly.
	-   I will grow old with you. 
		-   You felt uncertain about how I might react and feel about you as we age and change together
	-   I accept you as you are, and I offer myself in return.
		-   You did not feel accepted as you are.

I take full responsibility for hurting you with the words I said, and also with the judgmental thoughts I had (and have). I am sorry for how my actions hurt you, how they were a catalyst for self-doubt. I regret not taking the time to process my thoughts and feelings on my own before sharing them in a productive way.

**Reaffirm Love**
-   I love you.
-   I accept Sarah as she is, regardless of how she looks.
-   Our bodies will change. I look forward to experiencing the changes that life brings to our bodies and appreciating them together.
-   I know Sarah’s body will change with childbirth. I accept and embrace that. The changes our bodies go through are small memento’s and reminders of the life we are going through together, and I know I will appreciate them for that. 
-   I appreciate Sarah’s body as it is, wherever it is.
-   I want to be supportive and encouraging of her feelings about her body
-   I love you. I respect you.

I hope you can forgive me, that we can rebuild our trust, and that we can grow together from this moment.

**Restitution**
Things I can do:
-   Personal growth: Be aware on judgmental thoughts, talk about them with friends outside of Sarah, check in on judgment with counsellors/ therapy sessions.
-   Setup a time to meet with Nicole when we are in Calgary together
-   Quality Time: Istanbul together, Adam taking the lead on planning catchup talks
-   Acts of Service: Putting the apology into a written letter
What would Sarah like?
