My bicycle was stolen. 

Where: East side of de Bijenkorf Eindhoven store, North of 18 Septemberplein. The bike was locked at the first bike rack. 

When: the bike was left locked at approximately 16:58 on 12 December 2022. I arrived back at the location at approximately 21:54 on 12 December 2022. The bike was no longer there. 

What: The bike is a Brompton 2017 M3R Folding Bicycle in Lime Green and Black (serial number: 1710190489, frame number: 615277). The middle of the frame is black, the rear triangle, front fork and handle bar stem are lime green. The bike has a luggage rack, mudguards and dynamiter front and rear light. There is a small tool kit attached to the seat, and an additional rear red light attached to the seat post. The bike was locked with an Abus Bordo folding lock, and had a lock mount strapped to the main (middle) frame.
