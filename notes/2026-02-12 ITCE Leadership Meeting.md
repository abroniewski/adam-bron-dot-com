# Pride and Prejudice
- Need to make a decision
- Based on previous experience, we have been able to bring in €45k, need to find €15k
- Marsha to look at funding strategy for Nov Pride & Prejudice and May Production
- Marsha to look at multi-year funding 
- What are the other knock on effects of dual productions
	- Will we have enough actors to do 2 productions?
	- Will actors be willing to do both productions?
	- Need to balance resources (production, business etc.)
- What are the overlapping benefits?
	- Overlapping and continuous marketing and production
- Artistic vision -> does this production fit the description of the types of plays we want to do?
	- original idea for ITCE was topics that challenge culture
	- pride and prejudice is tapping into the feeling of home for people from abroad, which gives a connection to the community. Gives them something they miss in the Netherlands.
QUESTION: how do we make a choice on the themes and topics of the theater we do? Is it driven by the topic on the stage? Is it the types of people that attend the show? Is the the impact it has on the actor?
- What are the essential elements of a production that we can replicate?
- Pride and prejudice is an idea that is coming up and out of the ITCE community. We want to stoke the flame and encourage them. There is a tension between these two.
- We need to find a balance between all of these concepts.
- Do we have certain criteria for productions to move forward?
