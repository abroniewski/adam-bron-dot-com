In what empirical scenario would the Theory/Observation construct validity not apply?
- We use this to argue we "did the best we could", but the argument changes when we are dealing with qualitative data (instead of quantitive).
- It changes to describe the validity of the **work** instead of the data
How do we manage a combination of quantitative and qualitative work? Discuss both **threats to validity** AND **credibility**.
- Could end up in a section called validity, limitations, discussion etc. There will be a paragraph on credibility.
Also, we see things on "positionaility" -> where am I as a researcher relatvie to the research being done.

internal external conclusion construct

internal: something in the way that I processed or treated my data.
external: claim is stronger than the internal measurement.
conclusion: FInding a 

construct validity: needs both construct + operationalization -> construct is technical depth, and the labels are the things that 
- construct: theoretical concept, operationalization: giving something a number
- ideally use 
internal validity live at level of operationalization
If there is no generalization, than there is no threat to external validity

## Threats to Validity: Main Considerations
1. No an execuse to do nothing and have a "lazy" pipeline for the research
	- mitigate threats as best as possible and discuss them as such
2. Writing and identifying threats to validity is difficult
	- having discussions early can help refine things
	- for exam: reading paper and identifying threats is a skills.
		- take any paper we have read and write down the threats to validity, then compare to what the authors have found
	- Could make a conjecture that "method A is better than B, but needs to be further explored", and that kind of side-steps the validity question.
3. Try to decompose a paper into parts
	- what did author want to achieve, what methods did they use, and how did they align to the context. Look at how the sections relate to each other

# Today's Task
Read paper
Understand methodology
Extract threats to validity
Classify them (internal, external, construct, validity)

How GA are used
- how was subset made or selected?
- 446,862 engineered software project classification from RepoReapers
- Ruby kit to id GA
How use evolves
How GA is discussed
- manual analysis
- 209 issues, which ones? How selected?
	- Construct validity: "github action" or "github actions"
Impact of actions: did something change after adoption?
- 926 projects for minimum 6 months
