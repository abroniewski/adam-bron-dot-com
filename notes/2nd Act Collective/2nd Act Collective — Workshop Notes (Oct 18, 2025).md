## Why we met / today’s objectives

* Get **clarity on a “second group”**: inside ITCE vs. outside, with explicit pros/cons and a working preference. The room leans **start inside ITCE**, but set a **6-month limit** to validate; if it doesn’t work by ~June, we spin out.  
* **Create a community-focused org** using ITCE as a platform (and be ready to separate if needed). 
* Produce a **written artifact** (early business plan/value prop, scoped “why/what/how,” open questions) to guide conversations with ITCE. 
* Provide **structure** (timeline, next steps) so the work after *Pinter*/*Pride & Prejudice* doesn’t drop into a “black hole.” 

## Personal goals (selfish “what I want”)

* **Renske:** write plays that get produced and **paid**; act for fun with a good group (not always heavy); **stop doing marketing** (strategy, promotion, implementation).  
* **Liz:** be **more involved in production** (costumes, props, set, tools) and process; **step away from treasurer duties** (bills, payments, VAT/BTW quarterly); still enjoy sitting in the audience.  
* **Beata:** become a **paid director**, **build and be in community**, **teach acting**, **coach amateurs**, and develop a **portfolio/freelance career**. Enjoys **building** community even when it’s not there yet. 
* **Adam:** lead a project/business; build plans; hold people **accountable** and aligned to mission; contribute where it’s high-impact and **fun**. 

## Funding & financial context (CONFIDENTIAL)

* **ASML/Brabant C grant (€35k)** for *Visitors* was **rejected**. Keep this **confidential** (don’t share with potential *Visitors* actors yet). 
* Show will **still go ahead** (theatres booked); **re-cut budget** from ~€70k downward; other subsidy streams exist/are pending; **buffer fund €20k** exists to smooth losses. Expect *Pinter* to **lose €5–10k** (decision accepted in advance). 
* **Budget governance pain points**: line-item visibility and trade-offs (e.g., stools vs benches in *Pinter*), who owns cuts, and how creative “must-haves” are evaluated vs cost. Recommendation: require **director trade-off memos** (“If we keep X, we cut Y”) and insist on line-item review before approvals. 

## Value proposition (gaps we’re filling)

* **Capacity & inclusion gap**: ITCE’s current model (small casts, project-to-project focus) limits participation and **isn’t conducive to community formation** in rehearsals. People who **don’t want to act** but want to contribute (makeup, props, sets) have **no path**. 
* **International/Dutch blend**: some value the **challenge** and semi-pro standards; internationals need a home. We want **multiple levels** of theatre-making to match ambition/skills. 
* **Portfolio approach**: keep space for **Geert’s challenging, socially relevant work** (core trained actors + some amateurs) **and** run **popular plays** (e.g., *Pride & Prejudice*, *Macbeth*, *Romeo & Juliet*) to generate **bums-on-seats revenue** that can **cross-subsidize** art-house work. 
* **Positioning**: For Geert-style pieces with deep artistic approach, the primary audience might be **"high-brow" locals** who would be very willing to see the performance in Dutch; English-language versions are **harder to market** to that segment. 

## Safety, culture, and rehearsal practice (important additions)

* **Actor safety & consent**: several incidents surfaced (conflicting comfort signals; public call-outs; physicality without choreography; forgetting amateur needs). Implications: **risk of harm**, shaken confidence, and **loss of trust**. Actions:

  * **Define and enforce** intimacy/physicality protocols (opt-in consent, private check-ins, choreographed contact, separate movement sessions).
  * **Non-judgmental reporting** path (safety contact; incident follow-up with consequences).
  * **Routine check-ins** (P&P practice cited as positive). 

## Community (definition & mechanisms)

* **Define “community”** beyond actors: include makers (costume, set, tech), recurring volunteers, and engaged participants; clarify who is “crew” vs “community.” Current gap: board not visible to actors; limited feedback channels. Actions:

  * Introduce **board presence** at rehearsals (at least once), publish **who’s who**, and open an **actor feedback form** after *Pinter*. 
* **Continuity challenge**: new casts each project → relationships break → people drift. Our model: **parallel productions/workshops** so friendships and ensembles persist. 

## Program & portfolio (what we will run)

* **Workshops**: repeatable courses; **weekend “boot camps”** (Sat–Sun 10–17h + social), **dip-in/dip-out** modules; run **2+ workshops before end of summer** (one by Geert, one by Beata). Pricing likely supports **small profits** per run; revisit **participation fees** soon. 
* **Productions**: re-mount **Pride & Prejudice** at higher professionalism & lower cost to **generate surplus** that funds riskier work. Maintain stream of **popular classics** in rotation. 
* **Talent pipeline**: “new talent” track for **writers, directors, producers, actors**—raise quality via training so ITCE can **work with a larger pool** of semi-pro/pro collaborators. 

## Governance model (inside ITCE)

* Add **Community Leader (board role)**—owner of community programming and intake (proposed: Adam). **new new marketing lead**; aim for **international balance**. Consider expanding the **executive board** and running **tighter, operational monthly meetings**; invite directors **only for updates**. 
* Store work-in-progress for this project in a **private GDrive folder** (restricted to the four of us). 
* Clarify **creative direction**: if Geert acts as **creative director**, ensure representation for **other directors**; decouple director status from automatic board membership. 

## Strategic fit (ITCE)

* The second-group concept **directly fills ITCE strategy gaps**:

  1. **Community building**
  2. **Establish ITCE as THE English-speaking theatre in Brainport**
  3. **Financial and creative sustainability** (more than one production/year; portfolio of activities; talent development). 

## Marketing & audience learnings

* **Hard-to-market titles** (e.g., *Festen*, *Pinter*) need **heavy targeting**; relying on actors’ networks fails when actors feel peripheral or unsafe. Market research (survey) should **ask what people want to see/learn** before scheduling workshops or programming the next season. 
* For high-brow Dutch audiences, **English-language** is a barrier; popular titles in English help, but **positioning and access (venue, seating comfort)** matter to retirees/high-income segments. 

## Risks if nothing changes

* **Actor loss** (named examples); **quality declines**; **competing groups** form and compete for scarce **regional arts funds**; continued **production pattern** of budget/marketing scrambles; **leadership turnover** (Liz stepping back from treasurer; Renske exiting marketing). 

## Decisions & open items (with owners)

**Decisions**

* Try **inside ITCE** first; **re-evaluate by June** (≈6 months). 
* Program **two workshops before end of summer** (one by Geert, one by Beata), **informed by survey**. 

**Action items**

* **Artifact/business plan** draft (vision, portfolio, governance, budget rules, safety policy, 6-month milestones) — **Adam**. 
* **P&P case study** (compare to *Festen* outcomes; “bums on seats” economics; what worked in P&P process) — **Liz**. 
* **Budget for P&P re-mount** (lean design; professional look on a budget; revenue model) — **Liz**. 
* **Actor feedback form for Pinter** (experience, safety, learning, would you return?) — Adam to share drafted questionnaire, **Liz** to complete. 
* **Audience & community survey** (what titles/workshops people want; price sensitivity) — **Adam** to seed; **all** to review. 
* **Governance proposal** (add Community Leader; board cadence; director update format; budget trade-off process) — **Adam + Liz**. 

**Parking lot (to schedule)**

* **Participation fees & pricing** (actors; workshops). 
* **Define “community”** formally and publish roles/paths for non-actors.
