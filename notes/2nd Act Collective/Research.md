Below is an **objective evidence pack** you can drop into your “2nd Act Collective — Proposition Dossier.” I’ve erred on the side of **measurable facts, peer‑reviewed research and local comparators**. Where evidence is weaker or context‑dependent, I call it out and translate it into **assumptions to test** rather than claims.

---

## A. Local demand & context (Eindhoven / Brainport)

* **Population growth & international mix (audience + corporate market).** Eindhoven’s population rose to ~246–249k in 2024/25, with growth driven mainly by foreign migration and ~44% of residents having a migration background—creating a sizable international, English‑proficient audience and corporate client base. ([Eindhoven News][1])
  The Netherlands ranks **#1 worldwide for English proficiency**; North Brabant scores “very high,” reducing language‑friction for English‑language programming (but see Risks). ([EF][2])

* **Local theatre attendance at the flagship venue.** Parktheater Eindhoven reported **“~450 performances” and “over 260,000 visitors”** in 2024 across programs and activities, with **~194,825 visitors to performances** specifically (up from 176,814 in 2023). This indicates a healthy regional appetite for stage events. 

* **Broader Dutch theatre consumption.** In 2023, VSCD member venues counted **10.4 million visits** across **31,000 performances** with **136,000 seats**; the national infrastructure counts **584 theatre halls** (CBS) and **267k seats**. In 2022, **19%** of Dutch residents visited theatre; **40%** of people engaged in some performing‑arts practice. These are solid top‑down baselines for audience and participant pools. 

**Implication for your plan.** Eindhoven shows both **scale (Parktheater volumes)** and **audience breadth (national stats + internationals)**—supporting your dual aim: **popular classics for broad appeal** and **workshops/production‑track for makers**.
**Caveat.** English fluency ≠ equal willingness to attend English‑language *high‑brow* theatre (see Risks).

---

## B. Pricing & “what good looks like” comparators

* **Community & amateur theatre tickets (NL examples).** Many amateur/association shows price at **~€12.50** (examples from Zeeland/Drenthe associations). While not Eindhoven, these anchor a **lower‑bound** for accessible pricing. ([toneeltspektakel.nl][3])

* **Eindhoven improv/acting courses (consumer market).**
  • CKE Eindhoven runs an 8‑lesson improv course at **€189** (8×1.5h). ([CKE][4])
  • InterActing Eindhoven trial workshops charge **€17.50** per 75‑min session. ([InterActing][5])
  • Weekend improv training (Eindhoven) priced at **€195** for Fri–Sat formats. ([improcentrum.nl][6])
  • Amsterdam benchmark: Boom Chicago Academy Level 1 (8 weeks) **€325**. (Urban/premium ceiling for NL consumer pricing.)

* **Corporate workshops (local group‑rate benchmarks).**
  • National providers advertise **€300 (2h, 7–15 pax)** and **from €485 per group** for improv/theatre workshops—useful **floor** signals for B2B group‑rate positioning in Brabant. (Premium, bespoke in‑company programs price materially higher.) ([Uniekeuitjes.nl][7])

* **Learning & development spend (B2B budget context).**
  Global ATD trend: **$165 per “learning hour used”** in 2024 (↑34% YoY), signaling robust L&D willingness to pay; Europe (incl. NL) historically **>€300 per employee** annually in employer‑provided training (EIB survey; earlier year). Treat as **budget context**, not a price list. ([ATD][8])

**Implication.** For public tickets, **€12.50–€20** is defensible for community shows in secondary venues; **€16–€24** plausible for polished classics in comfortable rooms. For workshops, Eindhoven consumers see **€17–€25 per drop‑in** and **€180–€325 per 8‑week course**; corporate sessions should price well **above generic group floors** when outcomes are explicit (communication, collaboration) and delivery is bilingual/professional.

---

## C. Evidence on workshops & applied theatre outcomes (use to justify B2C/B2B demand)

* **Improvisation training effects.** Controlled studies and randomized experiments find improv participation can improve **divergent thinking, tolerance for uncertainty, self‑efficacy, and affect** versus other social activities; growing recent work examines **work‑related self‑efficacy** as an outcome. These are credible *intermediate* outcomes for both consumers and teams (not direct ROI). ([ImprovTalk][9])

* **Drama/theatre‑based learning reviews.** Systematic reviews across education/professional training contexts report positive effects on **communication, equity literacy, reflective learning**—transferable mechanisms your corporate modules can specify (e.g., feedback loops, “Yes/And” collaboration norms). Evidence is strongest in education/health; **corporate ROI evidence is thinner**, so frame outcomes as **skills & team processes**, not guaranteed performance gains. ([ScienceDirect][10])

* **Wellbeing & social value.** The UK DCMS/Frontier Economics programme estimates **substantial public value** from arts engagement and publishes valuation approaches linking **regular participation** to **mental health improvements and social capital**—useful to articulate social impact (with appropriate geographic caveats). ([GOV.UK][11])

**Implication.** Position workshops and in‑company offers around **validated, measurable intermediates** (psychological safety behaviors, communication quality, uncertainty tolerance), not promises of productivity spikes.

---

## D. Safety, inclusion & retention (risk reduction evidence)

* **Intimacy & consent practice.** Professional bodies provide concrete protocols (opt‑in consent, choreography of contact, check‑ins, reporting paths) that reduce risk and increase trust—relevant to incidents flagged in your notes. ([whatworkswellbeing.org][12])
  Your own workshop notes document specific **safety incidents** and the need for explicit intimacy protocols, routine check‑ins, and a non‑judgmental reporting path—use this as *internal* evidence of risk and a driver for policy adoption. 

* **Psychological safety & retention.** Meta‑analytic and empirical work links psychological safety to **team learning and performance**; volunteer and nonprofit studies connect **respect/engagement** with **retention**—relevant to sustaining amateurs, makers and crew. (Beware non‑linear effects at very high PS; structure matters.) ([ScienceDirect][13])

**Implication.** Publishing and enforcing a **Safety & Consent Pack** (intimacy direction, check‑ins, escalation, consequences) is both a moral and strategic move to **improve retention** of actors and crew—directly addressing a documented pain. 

---

## E. Translating evidence into your unit economics (with conservative baselines)

Below are **plug‑and‑play formulas** with defensible ranges from the evidence and local comparators. Replace assumptions with your real figures as you collect them.

### 1) Productions (classics as flywheel)

* **Inputs to set:** venue capacity, nights, price, expected occupancy.

* **Ticket price anchor:** €12.50–€20 (community), potentially higher for premium settings (see local comparators above).

* **Occupancy assumption:** start conservative; you sold out **3×110 seats mid‑week** for *Pride & Prejudice*—use that as a **ceiling** for similar titles, but model at **50–70%** until you have 2–3 titles’ data.

* **Example (illustrative, not a forecast):**
  If you remount *P&P*: **3 nights × 110 seats × €15** → 3×110=**330** seats; 330×€15 = **€4,950** gross.
  At **€18**, 330×€18 = **€5,940**; at **€20**, 330×€20 = **€6,600**.
  (Use this to decide how many nights/price points you need to cross‑subsidize one “message‑driven” piece.)

### 2) Workshops (consumer)

* **Price anchors:** €17–€25 per drop‑in; €180–€325 per 8‑week course, depending on brand/teacher/venue. ([CKE][4])
* **Capacity:** 10–16 is typical.
* **Example:** 12 participants × €189 course price = **€2,268** gross per run (8×1.5h). Instructor pay + room + marketing decide margin.

### 3) Corporate experiences (team communication / collaboration)

* **Local floors:** group improv workshops **€300–€485** for ~2 hours are advertised; bespoke bilingual, in‑company **half‑day** sessions typically price materially higher with explicit outcomes. ([Uniekeuitjes.nl][7])
* **Budget context:** global L&D cost per learning hour ~**$165** in 2024; prior European surveys place NL among countries with **>€300 per employee** annual training spend. Use these to justify **professional day rates**—don’t anchor to consumer class prices. ([ATD][8])

---

## F. Where the plan is strong vs. where to be cautious

**Strength signals (evidence‑aligned):**

* A sizeable, **English‑proficient, international** population mixed with locals suggests strong workshop and audience pools (but segment by title). ([EF][2])
* **Local venues are vibrant** (Parktheater ~195k performance visitors in 2024; ~260k across activities) supporting consistent demand for stage experiences. 
* **Consumer price benchmarks** for improv/acting courses and **group‑rate floors** for corporate sessions exist locally—reducing pricing ambiguity. ([CKE][4])

**Material risks & assumptions to keep honest:**

1. **Language/positioning risk.** High English proficiency does **not** guarantee that **Dutch, high‑brow segments** will attend English‑language drama; your own notes observe this barrier. Treat *classics in English* as your market maker; position art‑advancing work carefully (co‑creation, context programming, surtitles, partnerships). 
2. **Scheduling & inclusion constraints.** Adult participation is limited by **time, work, family, cost** (leisure‑constraint research; EU adult learning barriers). Design **weekend intensives, modular tracks**, and **sliding‑scale bursaries** accordingly. ([nrpa.org][14])
3. **Volunteer capacity & safety.** Burnout and unresolved incidents erode retention and reputation; build psychological safety systems and intimacy protocols (above). 
4. **Corporate ROI claims.** Evidence supports **skills and team‑process** gains; **hard ROI** claims are context‑specific. Sell **clear learning outcomes + behavioral metrics**, not generic “innovation boosts.” ([ScienceDirect][10])
5. **Cost inflation on productions.** Parktheater notes rising **show, housing and general costs**; assume tightening margins and prioritize **lean design + line‑item trade‑offs** (already flagged in your governance notes). 

---

## G. Validation plan (90 days) — convert risks into tests

Use Lean‑Startup style “innovation accounting” so we measure learning, not vanity metrics.

**1) Title/format fit (audience demand)**

* **Hypothesis:** English‑language classics can sustain ≥**60–70%** occupancy mid‑week in 150–250‑seat rooms.
* **Test:** Two staged readings (paid RSVP), AB test **title + blurb**; measure CTR → checkout and **RSVPs/week**.
* **Decision rule:** Proceed to full run only if ≥**0.8** RSVPs per seat within 14 days of announce (mid‑price).

**2) Price sensitivity (tickets)**

* **Hypothesis:** €16–€20 yields no more than **10%** drop in conversion vs €12.50 for classics in comfortable venues.
* **Test:** Van Westendorp survey + split‑pricing pre‑sale blocks.
* **Decision rule:** Pick the highest price tier with ≤10% conversion loss.

**3) Workshop cadence**

* **Hypothesis:** **Weekend intensives** open access for those blocked by weeknights; conversion + repeat intent ≥ weekday courses.
* **Test:** Run one **8‑week** and one **Sat–Sun intensive**; track **capacity fill**, **NPS**, **re‑enrol**.
* **Decision rule:** Keep formats with ≥**75%** fill and NPS≥**8**.

**4) Corporate offer**

* **Hypothesis:** Tech teams will purchase **half‑day** experiences at a premium above consumer group floors if outcomes (e.g., meeting dynamics, feedback loops) are explicit and bilingual.
* **Test:** 5 founder‑led **sales conversations** with Brainport firms (ASML ecosystem suppliers, scale‑ups), 2 pilots; measure **win rate** and **post‑session behavior change** (team debrief rubrics).
* **Decision rule:** Productize if **≥2** paying pilots and **≥70%** of participants report intended behavior change.

**5) Safety & retention**

* **Hypothesis:** Implementing intimacy protocols + routine check‑ins reduces incident rate and increases “would return” intent.
* **Test:** Publish **Safety & Consent Pack**, run **anonymous pulse** after rehearsals/performances; track incidents per 100 participants and “return” intent.
* **Decision rule:** Maintain policy if incidents stay **near zero** and return intent ≥**80%**.

(Framework references for the testing approach and metrics: **Lean Startup** & **VPD**.)

## H. What to paste into your Dossier (by section)

* **Problem & Insight (1):**
  • Audience & maker demand baselines: Parktheater 2024 visitors (performance and total), VSCD 10.4m visits, 19% theatre‑going rate; Eindhoven’s international growth. 
  • Constraint insight: adult participation barriers (time/cost) → justify **weekend intensives & modularity**. ([nrpa.org][14])

* **Proposition (2):**
  • Pricing anchors for shows/workshops; corporate group‑rate floors. ([toneeltspektakel.nl][3])
  • Evidence‑based learning outcomes for workshops (intermediates, not ROI). ([ImprovTalk][9])

* **Operating model & governance:**
  • Safety & Consent Pack rationale (reduce incidents, increase retention); psychological safety link to performance/retention. ([whatworkswellbeing.org][12])  

* **Financials & milestones:**
  • Use the **unit‑economics formulas** above; treat your *P&P* sell‑outs as **internal baseline** (ceiling), not forecast; expand only after two titles reach your conservative thresholds. (P&P evidence: your dossier + notes.) 

---

## I. Open questions / residual unknowns (to quantify next)

1. **Occupancy norms by genre and weekday in comparable venues** (NL small‑/mid‑scale theatre): DIP/VSCD detailed dashboards (if accessible) or Parktheater/Pand P historical averages. (We used venue totals; production‑level occupancy still to gather.) 
2. **NL‑specific L&D price points by sector (tech vs. public)** to refine corporate pricing bands. Current evidence gives direction (global budgets + local floors) but not NL median day‑rates. ([ATD][8])
3. **Audience segment response to English‑language high‑brow titles in Eindhoven** (survey and A/B title tests recommended).

---

## J. Your existing internal evidence (to cite internally, not publicly)

* Workshop notes log concrete **safety incidents**, **pricing intent** for workshops, **portfolio cross‑subsidy** logic, and the **€20k buffer** context; use these as *internal* constraints and governance triggers. 
* Notes also capture the **marketing barrier** for English‑language “high‑brow” titles to Dutch audiences; this should directly shape your **title and positioning tests**.
