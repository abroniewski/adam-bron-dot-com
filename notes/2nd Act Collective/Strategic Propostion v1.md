### **2. Vision & Purpose**

**Why this exists.**  
Draw directly from Beata’s Business Plan and workshop reflections.

#### 2.1. Vision Statement

> “To create a safe, inclusive theatre community where vulnerability becomes a source of strength, creativity, and connection.”

#### 2.2. Mission

> To build a sustainable theatre ecosystem in Brainport that empowers amateurs and semi-professionals to learn, perform, and connect through meaningful creative practice.

#### 2.3. Guiding Principles

- **Vulnerability as creative power.**
    
- **Community before hierarchy.**
    
- **Artistic integrity + accessibility.**
    
- **Safety and consent as non-negotiables.**
    
- **Financial sustainability = creative freedom.**
    

#### 2.4. The Human Value

Anchor in Maslow’s hierarchy (love/belonging, self-esteem, self-actualization) as identified in Beata’s reflections.

### **3. The Problem & Opportunity**

Synthesize from the Oct 18 workshop notes.

#### 3.1. The Problem (Current Gaps)

- ITCE’s current structure limits participation (small casts, few projects).
    
- Lack of continuity—relationships dissolve after productions.
    
- People who want to contribute (tech, costumes, set) have no clear path.
    
- Cultural safety incidents risk trust and retention.
    
- Funding reliance and burnout among key volunteers.
    

#### 3.2. The Opportunity

- Brainport needs a _recognizable English-speaking community theatre hub._
    
- Rising appetite for creative workshops and accessible productions.
    
- Hybrid international/Dutch community = unique social value.
    
- Proven creative leadership and early prototypes (_Pinter_, _P&P_).

### **4. Value Proposition Design**

Use the _Value Proposition Canvas_ (Strategyzer framework).

#### 4.1. For Participants (Actors, Directors, Volunteers)

- **Jobs to be done:** find creative outlet, learn acting, meet like-minded people, feel belonging.
    
- **Pains:** lack of safe and inclusive spaces; one-off shows; amateur stigma; scheduling fatigue.
    
- **Gains:** confidence, growth, friendships, joy, visibility, healing.
    

#### 4.2. For Audiences

- **Jobs:** seek meaningful entertainment, support local arts, connect socially.
    
- **Pains:** inconsistent quality, unclear branding, inaccessible language.
    
- **Gains:** inspiring, emotionally authentic performances in English; cultural exchange.
    

#### 4.3. For Partners (ITCE, venues, sponsors)

- **Jobs:** strengthen community engagement, cultural presence, and inclusivity.
    
- **Pains:** lack of structured, ongoing programming; capacity limits.
    
- **Gains:** strategic alignment with cultural and community objectives.

### **7. Governance & Culture**

**Inside ITCE (Phase 1):**

- **Community Leader (Adam)** — operational coordination, membership intake, community programming.
    
- **Creative Director (Geert)** — artistic standards, mentorship.
    
- **Directors (Beata + others)** — project-level creative leads.
    
- **Board oversight (Liz, Renske)** — finance, policy, communications.
    

**Cultural Code of Conduct:**

- Consent-first rehearsal practice.
    
- Feedback channels and safety contact role.
    
- “Assume positive intent, uphold clear boundaries.”
    
- Regular retrospectives after productions.
    

---

### **8. Financial Model**

_(Summarized, adaptable as testing data comes in.)_

- Target: break-even or small surplus across the portfolio.
    
- **Revenue sources:** ticket sales, workshop fees, local sponsorships, cultural subsidies.
    
- **Cost drivers:** venue rental, tech, costumes, marketing, rights, insurance.
    
- **Budget principle:** directors submit “trade-off memos” (keep X, cut Y).
    
- Example: _Pinter_ loss ≤ €10k offset by _P&P_ surplus + workshop margin.

### **9. Validation Plan (6-Month Inside ITCE Pilot)**

**Goal:** test whether the model works creatively, socially, and financially.

|Test Area|Hypothesis|Validation Method|Metric|
|---|---|---|---|
|Community retention|Parallel productions + workshops sustain connection|Track re-enrollment rate, community engagement|≥ 50% repeat participation|
|Workshop demand|Participants will pay €150–250 for weekend labs|Pilot 2 workshops, survey satisfaction|≥ 10 participants/session|
|Financial viability|Cross-subsidy can sustain mixed portfolio|Compare cost/revenue|< 10% deficit|
|Safety & culture|Protocols rebuild trust|Post-project surveys|≥ 80% feel safe/included|

Decision checkpoint: **June 2026** — remain in ITCE or spin out independently.

### **10. Brand & Communications**

**Tone:** inclusive, creative, grounded.  
**Name:** _2nd Act Collective_ = _your next chapter through theatre._  
**Channels:** ITCE website, Instagram, local expat newsletters, LinkedIn.  
**Messaging pillars:**

- “Everyone has a second act.”
    
- “Theatre for connection, not perfection.”
    
- “Join the play — onstage or off.”

### **11. Risks & Mitigations**

|Risk|Mitigation|
|---|---|
|Creative burnout|Rotate leadership, schedule downtime|
|Funding gaps|Workshops + low-cost classics to generate cash flow|
|Safety incidents|Clear protocols, trained intimacy coordinators|
|Volunteer overload|Define scope, clarify roles, use shared tools|
|Community drift|Maintain continuity through parallel activities|

---

### **12. Long-Term Vision (Post-June 2026)**

- **Scenario A:** remain within ITCE as a semi-autonomous branch.
    
- **Scenario B:** spin out as _independent cooperative_ or _foundation (stichting)_ with ITCE partnership.
    
- **Scenario C:** evolve into a **Brainport Community Arts Hub**, integrating theatre, improv, and creative wellbeing programs.
    

Include an early **roadmap** (2026–2028) with milestones:

1. Validate model inside ITCE
    
2. Secure sustainable funding
    
3. Formalize governance & brand
    
4. Expand into regional partnerships and creative residencies
