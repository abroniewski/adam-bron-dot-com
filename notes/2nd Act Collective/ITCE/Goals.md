ITCE has several interconnected goals that aim to achieve our mission of facilitating bridging cultural differences and our vision of contributing to the transformation of the Brainport region into a community where everyone feels a sense of belonging.

These goals can be categorised into two main areas:

1. Bridging cultural differences initiatives
    - Utilise the universal language of theatre: ITCE believes that theatre can be a powerful tool for breaking down barriers and fostering understanding. We employ interactive, multidisciplinary performances, workshops, and events to address contemporary societal issues and facilitate direct interaction between Dutch and international residents.
    - Provide a platform for diverse communities: ITCE aims to utilise its unique approach to develop and implement initiatives that promote cultural exchange and understanding between Dutch and international residents. ITCE seeks to provide a platform where people from diverse backgrounds can connect, learn from each other, and collaboratively contribute to the Brainport region’s cultural scene.  
        
2. Organisational growth and sustainability
    - Build a strong and interconnected community: ITCE places a strong emphasis on building a strong and interconnected community within its organisation. We believe that a sense of belonging is essential for both individual growth and the success of our initiatives to bridge cultural differences.
    - Develop strategic partnerships: To amplify our reach and impact, ITCE plans to develop strategic partnerships with key cultural organisations, acting clubs, and educational institutions in Eindhoven and beyond. These partnerships will allow ITCE to enrich our offerings, expand our network, and collaborate on projects that benefit the wider community.
    - Communicate a clear value proposition: ITCE recognises the importance of clearly communicating our value proposition to attract and retain members, partners, and supporters. This includes highlighting the benefits of joining ITCE, such as personal growth, skill development, cultural exchange, and community bonding.

To support goals 1 and 2, the following sub goal has been identified:

- Connect with funding bodies for ITCE and others’ initiatives to bridge cultural differences.
    
    - Establish a dedicated funding program: ITCE aims to convince the Brainport region to establish a dedicated funding programme for initiatives to bridge cultural differences. This programme would complement existing infrastructure projects by focusing on the social and cultural aspects. ITCE believes that bridging cultural differences is essential for building a resilient and harmonious community.
    
    - Collaborative advocacy: ITCE plans to collaborate with other international cultural organisations to create a joint proposal for the Brainport region. This collaborative approach aims to amplify our voice and demonstrate the collective need for such a programme.
