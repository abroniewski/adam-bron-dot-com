### Why we’re meeting

This session is about getting aligned on where we’re heading and turning that into practical next steps we can actually deliver. The focus is on clarity, priorities, and ownership, not on polishing perfect answers.

By the end of the session, we want to have:

- A shared understanding of the current strategic plan
- A clear sense of where the main gaps are
- Agreement on what’s realistic given our current people and energy
- Concrete next actions, with owners and rough timelines
- Clearer role boundaries across the organisation, with a deeper focus on defining the Community Developer role and how it connects with the other roles

---

## Agenda

### 14:00–14:15 | Kick-off

- What we want to get out of the afternoon
- How we’ll work together to keep things focused and useful

---

### 14:15–14:45 | Strategic plan orientation

- Short individual and small-group reflection on the current strategic plan
- What still feels solid and worth protecting
- What feels unclear, outdated, or missing

_Outcome:_ A shared baseline and a clear set of questions to work from.

---

### 14:45–15:30 | Strategic gaps and what they mean

- Group discussion to surface and clarify the key gaps
- Focus on what these gaps mean in practice if we don’t address them

_Outcome:_ A clear, consolidated list of gaps.

---

### 15:30–16:10 | Break (40 minutes)

---

### 16:10–16:35 | Prioritising what matters most

- Decide which gaps matter most over the next six months
- Be explicit about what we’re choosing to focus on, and what we’re not (for now)

_Outcome:_ 3–5 clear priority areas.

---

### 16:35–17:10 | Capacity check and making it workable

- Honest discussion about people, capacity, and energy
- What’s realistically achievable
- How we might move things forward when resources are tight

_Outcome:_ Approaches that are grounded in our current reality.

---

### 17:10–17:40 | Roles and accountabilities

- Clarifying role boundaries
- Main focus on defining the Community Developer role, since it’s new
- Also clarifying the scope and how we interact with existing roles (Director, Production Assistant, Business Lead, Board)
- Surfacing overlaps, gaps, and decision boundaries

_Outcome:_ Draft clarity on all roles, with extra depth on the Community Developer role, plus a list of things to refine further if needed.

---

### 17:40–18:00 | Commitments and close

- Locking in next actions, owners, and rough timelines
- Quick alignment check and final reflections

_Outcome:_ Clear next steps and shared confidence in the way forward.

### A few notes

- This is a working session. Some things will be decided, others may be framed as experiments or proposals to refine.
- We’ll time-box discussion so we leave with momentum.
- Saying “we can’t do this right now” is valid and important input.
