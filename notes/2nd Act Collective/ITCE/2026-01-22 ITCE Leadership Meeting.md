## 2. Key Discussion Points

### Technical & Venue Costs

- Discussion focused on technician costs for seating/tribune setup.
    
- Emails from the venue were unclear on:
    
    - Total hours required (4 vs 8 hours).
        
    - Number of technicians required (likely two).
        
- Indicative rate discussed: ~€40–€57/hour per technician.
    
- Agreement that clarity is required before confirming costs.
    

### Workshop Registration & Payment Friction

- Improv workshop oversubscribed (15 sign-ups for 14 places).
    
- Issues identified:
    
    - Participants registering without paying.
        
    - Manual follow-ups consuming admin time.
        
- Strong consensus that registration should require immediate payment to confirm a place.
    

### Community & Development Pilot – Early Signals

- Buddy system implemented for _The Visitors_ rehearsals.
    
- Returning members paired with new participants.
    
- Observed outcomes:
    
    - Immediate social integration.
        
    - Reduced reliance on production staff for basic questions.
        
    - Increased sense of ownership among returning members.
        

### Pride & Prejudice Remount

- Not formally on the agenda.
    
- Clarified that preparation work is progressing in parallel:
    
    - Budgeting.
        
    - Venue exploration.
        
    - Packaging options in advance of formal approval.
        
- Intent is readiness, not premature commitment.
    

### Marketing Capacity for _The Visitors_

- Urgent need for short-term marketing execution support.
    
- Options discussed:
    
    - Sam (known quantity, strong media network).
        
    - Bridget (question marks around Dutch media network and work eligibility).
        
- Marketing plan already exists and is considered sufficient; execution is the gap.
    

### Medium-Term Artistic Direction (2027+)

- Geert outlined several possible productions:
    
    - _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ (modernised concept).
        
    - Shakespeare adaptations with community or youth involvement.
        
    - Other works (e.g. Sam Shepard, musical concepts).
        
- Consensus that market input would be valuable before committing.
    

### Funding & Strategic Narrative

- Strong emphasis on the need for:
    
    - A coherent story connecting:
        
        - Artistically driven productions.
            
        - Community-driven productions.
            
        - Workshops and outreach.
            
    - Clear role ownership, especially around funding asks.
        
- This narrative is critical for subsidy and sponsorship applications.
