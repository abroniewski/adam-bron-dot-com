# Community Update

### The Visitors. Kick-off and early community framing

- Attended the initial meeting for The Visitors.
- Shared brief context on the Community & Development pilot and its intent.
- Positioned the production as a live testbed for community-supporting practices rather than a separate initiative.

### Buddy system. Setup and early feedback

- Implemented a simple buddy system to support onboarding and connection.
- Early feedback indicates it reduced social friction, especially for first-time or less experienced participants.
- Participants reported feeling more grounded and less unsure of their role in the room.

### Rehearsal weekend. Observations and signals

- Emotional check-in introduced at the start of rehearsals.
- Clear impact observed: faster trust formation, more openness, lower barriers early in the process.
- Supported psychological safety without slowing rehearsal momentum.
- Reinforces the value of lightweight, repeatable community practices.

### Website. Operational progress and documentation

- Liz made a significant step forward in updating the website.
- Worked through notification settings together, resolving outstanding issues and getting them fully operational.
- Implemented a few small usability and structural improvements.
- Created new guidance documents to support ongoing use of key website functionality.
- Result: reduced dependency on ad hoc support and improved confidence in maintaining the site.

### Pride and Prejudice. Budget and groundwork

- Worked with Liz on the Pride and Prejudice budget.
- Budget is now in a solid exploratory state and usable for planning conversations.
- Collected and reviewed multiple potential locations and venue information.
- We are in a good position location-wise once timing and funding are clarified.

### Pride and Prejudice remount. Decision readiness

- Key open question: what needs to be in place to formally move forward.
- Suggested next step: clarify decision gates.
    - Budget confidence.
    - Venue availability.
    - Minimum funding secured or clearly identified.
- Request alignment on when a “go” decision can reasonably be made.

### Funding landscape. Visibility before action

- No immediate applications proposed.
- Request to map what funding is already available or potentially accessible.
- Goal is understanding, not commitment, so we can plan realistically and avoid rushed decisions later.

### Participation fees. Deferred but planned

- Did not deliver a clear value proposition for actor participation fees in time for The Visitors.
- This was a capacity issue, not a strategic objection.
- Action item: develop a clear, fair participation fee rationale and framing ahead of Pride and Prejudice.
- Target delivery: next leadership meeting.

### Upcoming brainstorm. Structure and pre-read

- Planning a brainstorm session focused on next steps for Pride and Prejudice and Community & Development.
- I have pre-read material ready to share in advance to ground the discussion.
- Open question for the board:
    - What format would be most useful.
    - What preparation or structure is expected from participants.

---

## Action Items. Adam

- Develop participation fee value proposition for actors.
- Prepare funding landscape overview.
    
- Share pre-read material ahead of brainstorm.
    
- Propose a simple decision framework for Pride and Prejudice remount.
