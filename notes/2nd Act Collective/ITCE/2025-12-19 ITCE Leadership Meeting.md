# Visitors Budget Review
Already paid Esther €5000
Cultturfonds - 5k
cultuur eindhoven - 15k
ASML community - 2k
VSB - 8k (13 weeks to assess, starts now. We don't know why they reduced the request amount)
CKE - 2.5k
Eigen inbreng (own input) - 7.5k

Wont know until Feb/March how much funding is coming in.

## Set build/design
- Hard to know what the balance between costs and payment would be.
- Have people that are willing to build, but need to have designs built out
- Ream can be the one to build the set
	- can get an estimate
	- Break the estimate out by:
		- design
		- materials
		- building time
	- Ask them the max is 4k.
- Ream is a handyman, used to be a director
- Working through the school was a "No" for this school year

## Props
- ask cast to bring own things, can bring cost down to 500

## Hair and Makeup
- budgeted at 500, 
- get the cast to do their own hair and makeup, Anne runs a workshop for theater makeup
	- this way it can be dropped to 250

8 shows
100 seats per show
= 800 tickets total x 11EUR = 8800
max = 11000
60% capacity assumption based on 125 seats

Decision: Greenlight to move forward with The Visitors play.


# Contribution fees
- use fee to drive commitments for attendance
- use 
- contribution fee should be proportional to the number of lines
discussed different ways that contribution fees can be managed.
Liz provided some options on how this could be done.
Adam suggested better articulation of the value being given to actors paying fees. Adam suggested actors can "work off" their fees by volunteering time to theater group, which could reduce the overall budget of productions, increaase the on-paper budget used in applications, and drive more community building through theater making engagement.

Questions:
