The second part of the marketing campaign consists of the short-term marketing strategy, which we apply for upcoming performances to maximise engagement and ticket sales.

This short-term marketing strategy is employed while we keep in mind that a marketing campaign is always flexible: we might need to adjust to circumstances both in and out of our control, and we might learn that certain aspects of the campaign wield better results than others. Therefore, we consider this short-term marketing plan as a living strategy, which we may adjust as needed.

The short-term marketing strategy will be spread out across different marketing channels:

- Social media:  
    By creating engaging content, such as behind-the-scenes glimpses, interviews with actors, and event announcements, we generate a ‘buzz’ surrounding our next play. Social media is also used to run contests and giveaways to further increase engagement, but this should be in line with the theme of the play (and appropriate).
- Community partnerships:  
    By setting up partnerships with local businesses, community centres, and expat groups we promote an upcoming play or workshop in the Brainport region. This involves distributing flyers, hosting joint events, and cross-promoting each other's activities.
- Targeted advertising:  
    Advertising on social media and possibly search engines reaches individuals interested in theatre, cultural events, and initiatives to bridge cultural differences. The advertising highlights the theme of the play and our unique value proposition of bridging cultural differences through theatre.
- Email:  
    Sending regular newsletters to previous audience members with event updates, behind-the-scenes insights, and testimonials from participants builds an established audience of regular visitors. We explore the possibility of offering incentives such as early-bird discounts or exclusive content.
- Regular media:  
    By contacting different media outlets, we secure press coverage and interviews, adding importance to the play and reaching individuals who might not be reached via social media or other channels.

Once the script and dates (and venue) for a specific performance have been selected, we initiate the following timeline, starting six months before the first date of performing:

## 6 Months before the performance

- Define target audience and customise the marketing strategy  
    We identify the target audience for the performance. This does not consist merely out of both Dutch and international residents of the Brainport region who are interested in theatre, cultural events, and cultural initiatives. Each play has a specific theme, and that theme is what connects us to a target audience. For instance, additional target audiences for Festen could have been fans of Dogma films, Danish people in the Netherlands, psychologists who work with people from unstable homes, etc. Based on the target audience, we develop a marketing strategy that outlines the key messages, communication channels, and specific promotional activities to be employed.
- Design marketing materials  
    Start the design of the poster, which can later be used as flyer. The poster should showcase the ITCE logo, the performance theme, date, time, venue, and ticketing information if already available. The design of the poster may be used to also set up an email template.
- Website updates  
    Create a dedicated page on the ITCE website for the upcoming performance. The webpage highlights the performance's theme, relevance to ITCE's mission, and connection to bridge cultural differences in the Brainport region.

## 5 Months before the performance

- Explore potential partnerships  
    Begin identifying potential community partners who can help promote the performance and expand its reach. This could include local businesses, cultural centres, educational institutions, and expat groups. Consider what ITCE can offer these partners in return for their support. Research the potential to set up a joint workshop, an event hosted by (some of) the cast and crew, a partnership with a charity or a school, etc.
- Social media channels  
    Decide which social media channels we will use to promote the play (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, X, BlueSky, etc). These channels need to reach our target audience. If a channel does not match with our target audience, we do not need to employ said channel.
- Cast headshots  
    In preparation of social media posts concerning the cast, we start taking headshots of everyone involved. These headshots may immediately be shared on the ITCE website. They will be shared on social media later on.
- Cast group photo  
    While we are shooting headshots, we also shoot a photo of the cast as a group, which will be used for future promotion. Much like the headshots, this will also be uploaded to the website.
- Behind-the-scenes footage  
    Start recording behind-the-scenes footage to be shared on social media later on. Think about warming ups, actors being coached by the director, a day in the life of a member of the production team, a potential gag reel, choreography of fight scenes, how actors collaborate on different scenes, how different cultural backgrounds merge together, what the impact of cultural background is on the acting process, etc. The goal of this footage is not only to share short clips on social media, but also to create one longer video shot over a longer period of time to show the community behind ITCE.

## 4 Months before the performance

- Social media engagement  
    Start posting regularly on ITCE's social media platforms about the upcoming performance. At this point in time, regularly is approximately once a week. Start by highlighting the play's theme, the cast and crew involved, behind-the-scenes content, the connection to ITCE's mission of bridging cultural differences, and how this play will be an interactive and multidisciplinary experience by focusing on how the audience makes an impact on the performance and which different forms of storytelling will be used in the play. The official headshots will be shared later on.
- Finalise community partnerships  
    Solidify partnerships with chosen community organisations. Set up agreements on promotional activities, such as co-hosting events, distributing marketing materials, and cross-promoting the play through their networks.
- Initiate emailing campaign  
    Send out first email to the existing mailing list, announcing the play, theme, cast, crew, and (if known) when the tickets will be on sale. Highlight if there will be an early bird discount. Any side events, such as workshops or agreements with partners, will be shared in this email as well.

## 3 Months before the performance

- Produce marketing materials  
    Based on the poster that was created in the step ‘6 months before’, have more posters in different sizes and flyers printed, so these can be distributed. These materials should showcase the performance theme, date, time, venue, and ticketing information. Flyers can be distributed to the partners as agreed in the prior steps, cultural venues, libraries, and also hotels where international visitors may be looking for an activity in Eindhoven.
- Begin ticket sales  
    Launch ticket sales through the ITCE website, ensuring clear communication about pricing, seating options, and any available discounts. We may offer a temporary early bird discount to reward the people who signed up to our mailing list. If so, decide until when we do this and when the regular prices will take effect.
- Email campaign  
    Announce the start of the ticket sales and the benefit of the early bird tickets (if applicable).
- Social media engagement  
    Increase social media posts to twice a week. Highlight the early bird discount. Start sharing the official headshots.
- Cast and crew interviews  
    Start recording (short) interviews which can be shared on social media and the website later on in the campaign. Ask cast and crew about their working processes, how they interpret their character, the impact of their culture on their performance, and the different cultural dynamics within ITCE. Additionally, have them say something positive about fellow cast and crew members. Focus on how different cultural aspects within the group are ITCE’s largest asset.

## 2 Months before the performance

- Increase social media marketing  
    Increase the frequency of social media posts to three times a week. Share engaging content such as rehearsal photos and videos, interviews with the cast and crew, information about the play's themes and relevance to contemporary issues, audience testimonials from past performances, activities/agreed promotion with partners, etc. Share a day in the life of our music composer, costume designer, set designer, etc.
- Initiate targeted advertising  
    Launch targeted advertising campaigns on social media platforms and possibly search engines, focusing on demographics interested in theatre, cultural events, and those who might be open to initiatives concerning bridging cultural differences. Add the target groups as defined in the first step to the advertising campaigns. These campaigns should drive traffic to the ITCE website (and we are able to see this data to determine which advertisements are effective and which are not, and adjust advertisements where necessary).

## 1 Month before the performance

- Media outreach  
    Set up and send a press release to local and regional media outlets introducing the play and emphasizing its relevance to bridging cultural differences in the Brainport region. When writing the press release, keep in mind to focus on the question ‘why is this news?’. Highlight the play's themes, the creative team, and ITCE's broader mission. The press release should be send no later than 2 weeks before the play. It helps to include high-quality photo material, such as the official poster.
- Professional photo shoot  
    Shoot professional photos of the play in action, preferably with the actors in their costume. Additionally, get a group photo of the cast while in character. Consider whether there should be an additional round of actor headshots, but in character. This might apply if the effect of makeup and costume is substantial.
- Increase social media marketing  
    Increase the frequency of social media posts to three/four times a week. Share information about the interactive element of the play. How will the audience experience it? Will they participate at a certain level? Will their seating be different from what they are used to so they will have an immersive experience? Highlight the different elements of storytelling and how this performance is a multidisciplinary production.
- Email campaign  
    Remind people of the ticket sales and share any relevant updates, such as final preparations, joint activities with community partners, media coverage, or a short interview with the director.
- Targeted advertising  
    Continue the advertisement campaign based on our learnings from the step ‘2 months before’.

## 2 Weeks before the performance

- Send performance reminders  
    Send email reminders to ticket holders and those who have expressed interest. Highlight key details about the performance, including the date, time, venue, parking information, wheelchair access, when the doors open, etc.
- Leverage partner networks  
    Encourage community partners to promote the performance through their communication channels, reaching a wider audience within their networks.
- Targeted advertisements  
    Depending on the ticket sales, decide whether a final advertisement should be send out.

## 1 Week before the performance

- Social Media Blitz  
    Intensify social media and post (almost) daily to generate excitement and encourage last-minute ticket sales. Share behind-the-scenes photos and videos of the location, the building of the set, media coverage, cast and crew interviews, and audience testimonials.

## During the days of performances

- Social media updates  
    Share live updates and behind-the-scenes content throughout the day of the performances. Share audience testimonials. This keeps the audience engaged and captures the energy of the event.

After the performances, we will continue to build on the momentum, by initiating the post-performance marketing. This will also contribute to our long-term marketing campaign and lay the groundwork for future engagement.

## Post-Performance

- Express gratitude  
    Immediately after the performances, express sincere gratitude to the audience, cast, crew, partners, and volunteers. This will be done through social media posts, emails, and a dedicated thank-you section on the ITCE website.
- Performance Highlights  
    Share photos and videos capturing the best moments of the performance. These could include captivating scenes, audience reactions, and behind-the-scenes glimpses. This content helps to keep the energy of the performance alive and provides a lasting impression for those who attended. We might interview several audience members after having seen the play.
- Website  
    Update the website with an After Movie, a collection of our behind-the-scenes videos, and cast and crew interviews to generate a proper representation of the community behind ITCE.
- Strengthen our funding efforts for future plays  
    Success stories for future funding: where possible, we compile data and stories from the performance that illustrate its positive impact on bridging cultural differences. This information can be used to strengthen our case for funding from the Eindhoven Municipality and other potential sponsors.
- If possible, gather (measurable) data related to audience diversity and engagement.
    
    - Testimonials from participants about the performance's impact on their understanding of different cultures and their sense of belonging in Eindhoven.
    
    - Evidence of successful collaborations with partner organisations.
    
    - Share the success of the performance with other international cultural organisations in the Brainport region, reinforcing the collective need for a dedicated funding programme for initiatives that bridge cultural differences. This shared success story can add weight to joint proposals directed at the Eindhoven Municipality.
- Announce upcoming performances

We utilise the post-performance momentum to start generating interest in the next upcoming production, by teasing future performances and workshops on social media and through email lists, and highlighting how they will continue to advance our mission of bridging cultural differences.

By implementing these post-performance marketing activities, we extend the impact of our productions, and solidify our position as a leader in bridging cultural differences, while cultivating a thriving community that supports its ongoing mission.
