Understanding “Community” and Its Dimensions

Before diving into tactics, it helps to define what _community_ means in this context. In social psychology, a “sense of community” is the feeling of belonging to a group, where members matter to one another and share faith that their needs will be met through their commitment together[1][2]. Classic community theory (McMillan & Chavis, 1986) breaks this sense of community into four key elements[3]:

- **Membership:** Clear boundaries of who is in the community, giving members a sense of belonging and identification (often reinforced by symbols like club T-shirts or rituals)[4]. Members value being _recognized_ as part of the group.
- **Influence:** A feeling that one’s voice matters in the group. Members need opportunities to contribute ideas and see that others listen and respond – “my voice counts”[5]. Likewise, the group’s norms can influence members’ behavior to align with community values.
- **Fulfillment of Needs:** People join communities to satisfy needs or interests. In a theatre non-profit, this could be creative fulfillment, social connection, skill development, or even résumé-building. A community works when members feel their participation is rewarding and beneficial[6].
- **Shared Emotional Connection:** The intangible but crucial element – a shared history, bonding experiences, or traditions that create emotional ties between members[7]. This might come from working on a challenging production together, inside jokes, or collective memories of past events.

These dimensions are interdependent. Psychologist Seymour Sarason noted that a true community arises when members feel similar to each other, acknowledge their interdependence, are willing to give to others, and feel part of a larger stable structure[1]. In other words, community is not just proximity or an organizational chart – it’s the _quality of relationships and the mutual commitment_ among members. A strong sense of community has been linked to higher participation and civic engagement: when people feel connected and that they matter, they are more likely to be active contributors[8].

Why Community Engagement Matters in Arts & Non-Profits

Fostering this sense of community isn’t just a feel-good goal; it’s vital for the success of volunteer-driven arts organizations. Research shows that active, engaged communities – where people regularly show up and contribute – rely on a strong sense of community among members[9][10]. Members who feel they belong and are valued will naturally be more willing to volunteer their time and energy. In fact, participation in the arts correlates with higher social involvement in general. For example, arts participants are **more than twice as likely to volunteer in their communities** compared to non-participants, independent of other factors[11]. They also tend to attend more group meetings and report lower feelings of loneliness, indicating that arts engagement and social connectedness go hand-in-hand[12][13].

For a theatre non-profit, an engaged community means full volunteer crews, enthusiastic casts, and audiences filled with friends and family. It means members take initiative to organize events, help newcomers, and sustain the organization through challenges. In contrast, without a sense of community, you might see volunteer burnout, apathy, or a handful of people doing all the work. A healthy community is self-reinforcing: people enjoy contributing because it’s **fun and fulfilling**, which in turn makes them more likely to stay involved[14]. As one theatre practitioner succinctly put it, _“theatre is community, and communities are not built in a day”_[15] – it takes consistent effort to cultivate, but it’s essential for longevity.

Context: An International Theatre Community in the Netherlands

In the case of an English-language theatre group in the Netherlands (such as ITCE), building community comes with special opportunities and challenges. The community likely includes a mix of Dutch locals and expats/immigrants from various countries. This diversity is a strength – members bring different perspectives and can learn from each other – but it requires mindful inclusion strategies. Language is the first consideration: using English as the common language makes the group accessible to internationals, while Dutch members who join are usually comfortable in English and may enjoy the international vibe. Still, cultural differences in communication and expectations can arise, so creating an environment of respect and curiosity about each other’s backgrounds is important.

It’s worth noting that volunteerism is _deeply ingrained in Dutch culture_: about half of the Dutch population volunteers at least once a year (at schools, sports clubs, community centers, etc.)[16]. Many Dutch people are used to community involvement, which bodes well for an arts volunteer base. For expats, joining a volunteer community can be a powerful way to integrate and combat isolation. Expat advice sources often suggest volunteering as a way to meet locals, learn some language and feel more “at home” in the Netherlands[17]. In a theatre setting, an expat who might feel like they “don’t belong anywhere” can suddenly find a family in the cast and crew of a show. Indeed, theatre projects have been used specifically to help immigrants and refugees build confidence and a _sense of belonging_ in their new country[18]. The collaborative nature of theatre – working together on a play, sharing stories – naturally fosters solidarity. One migrant-focused theatre group observed that participants who started out shy and isolated “open up, build friendships, and develop a strong sense of belonging” through the process of creating plays together[18].

However, to reach that point, barriers have to be addressed. New internationals might assume a theatre club is a closed clique or worry their skills (or accents) aren’t good enough; locals might hesitate if they think the group is just for expats. To counter these perceptions, the group should emphasize that it’s open to all and actively invite people in. Having a mix of events – some specifically targeting new folks (like open house workshops) and others celebrating cultural diversity – can signal inclusivity. Also, practical considerations like meeting locations, transportation, and cost should be kept accessible. _(One insight from a UK migrant theatre project: they grew their community by keeping workshops free or low-cost, covering travel for those who needed it, and even offering food – making participation feasible and welcoming for migrants with limited resources[19].)_ While the Dutch context may differ, the principle stands: reduce barriers so that anyone interested (whether a Dutch amateur actor or an expat who loves backstage work) feels truly invited to join.

Lastly, bridging between the international and Dutch members might mean sometimes bilingual communication or context-setting about Dutch culture vs. others. But often the shared passion for theatre provides a common ground that transcends nationality. In fact, arts are a great leveller and connector. Studies suggest that approaches to social inclusion which combine **local, face-to-face activities** (like community arts events) with broader support are highly effective for integrating immigrants, more so than abstract policy alone[11]. In short, by putting on shows and workshops where locals and foreigners collaborate, your theatre can become a vibrant intercultural community on its own.

Strategies and Activities to Foster Community Engagement

With the theory in mind and context understood, we can outline concrete tactics to build a stronger sense of community in an arts non-profit like ITCE. These ideas blend sociological best practices with practical event planning. Think of them as levers to address each of the community dimensions (membership, influence, needs, emotional connection).

**1. Create Welcoming Onboarding Experiences:** First impressions matter. When new members (actors, volunteers, or even interested audience members) come in, make them feel valued right away. Consider a _buddy system_ where each newcomer is paired with an experienced member who can introduce them around and guide them through their first activities. Early personal connections foster belonging and encourage people to stick around[20]. For example, if a new volunteer signs up to help with costumes, pair them with a “buddy” from the costume team who can show them the ropes and have coffee together. Also, provide a brief orientation or welcome packet that explains how to get involved in different aspects (acting, crew, front-of-house, etc.), so newcomers see there are multiple paths to participate. A thoughtful onboarding (clear roles, a warm welcome email, personal introductions) helps newcomers feel _“confident and ready to make an impact”_ from day one, which improves retention and builds that sense of being part of a team[21].

**2. Emphasize Clear Membership and Identity:** Make sure people know they are _members_ of a special community. This doesn’t necessarily mean formal membership fees or cards (though it could, if that fits your model), but it does mean communicating who is “in the family.” You might compile a directory or a private Facebook/WhatsApp group for members. Little things like group t-shirts or production hoodies with the theatre’s logo can reinforce identity and pride (many theatre companies have traditions of show shirts or cast photos – these become badges of belonging). Be **inclusive** in defining membership: your community likely includes not just actors, but crew, instructors, and possibly frequent audience supporters. (In one ITCE workshop discussion, members noted that the theatre’s community shouldn’t be thought of as _just_ the actors on stage – people who contribute off-stage or even loyal audience members can also feel part of the “theatre family,” and it’s beneficial to acknowledge them as such.) Ensuring everyone, from the lighting tech to the social media volunteer, feels recognized as a vital member combats any clique perception. Clearly communicate who is considered part of the community and welcome all those who are interested in the mission[22]. For instance, if you launch a new improv night open to the public, explicitly invite not only current volunteers but also audience members and friends to join – “once you’ve done a show or even attended a few, you’re part of our community!”

**3. Encourage Member Influence and Voice:** People engage more when they have a say. Build in channels for members to offer input and see it implemented. This could be as simple as post-event debrief circles, periodic surveys, or having an open forum during monthly meetings. Ensure **everyone’s voice can be heard** – from newcomers to veterans[23]. For example, after each production or workshop, hold a casual feedback session: what went well, what could improve? Or have a suggestion box (physical or digital) for ideas on future shows or social events. Even if leadership or a board makes final decisions, incorporate member ideas wherever possible and let them know their contributions matter. Another approach is involving members in planning committees – e.g. a committee for social events or a volunteer who coordinates the next play reading event. When people see their ideas (like “let’s do a costume-themed party” or “we should have a playwriting workshop”) put into action, their sense of ownership and loyalty grows. _Influence_ is a two-way street: invite members to influence the group, and ensure the group’s culture also positively influences individuals. Setting up a culture of respect, openness, and valuing input will make volunteers feel safe to speak up. At minimum, **for every event or activity, design it to be welcoming and create opportunities for everyone to contribute** in some way[23] (for instance, even at a holiday party, you might have a potluck or a open mic portion so attendees aren’t just passive).

**4. Meet Members’ Needs and Interests:** Regularly take the pulse of why people are here and what they want out of it, then tailor activities to those motivations. In a theatre non-profit, members might crave things like improving their acting skills, making friends, getting performance opportunities, giving back to the community, or just having fun after work. Try to offer a range of involvement opportunities to match these needs. **Workshops and training sessions** are one great tool: some members (especially newer or less-experienced actors) will appreciate improv classes, acting courses, tech training, etc. Providing those not only builds skills but also keeps them engaged between big productions. In fact, ITCE has identified that running repeatable workshops (some open to the public, some “members-first”) can serve as a talent pipeline and keep people involved year-round[24]. Similarly, consider “low-barrier” ways to participate for those who can’t commit to a full 3-month production – e.g. one-day stage combat workshops or weekly drama club nights. This meets the needs of members who have varying schedules or commitment levels (_learners seeking short, fun engagements_ vs. _die-hards wanting to be in every show_[25]).

Also, recognize that not everyone wants to act; some may love theatre but prefer to contribute in other ways (design, set building, marketing, etc.). If those avenues aren’t available, you lose potential community members. For example, one analysis of ITCE noted that the traditional model of only doing small-cast plays left little room for non-actors, which _“isn’t conducive to community formation… People who don’t want to act but want to contribute (makeup, props, sets) have no path”_. The remedy is to **create roles and projects for these folks**: invite volunteers for stage crew, start a costume-making circle, or run events like script readings where someone can participate as a reader or a moderator even if they’re not a performer. By fulfilling different interests, you broaden the community and make more people feel valued. Regularly ask your members (via surveys or informal chats) what they’d like to do that they aren’t doing yet, and try to provide it[26]. If the content or activities aren’t aligning with member needs, engagement will drop off[26], so this adaptive approach is key.

**5. Foster Shared Experiences and Traditions:** _Emotional connection_ builds over time when people share meaningful moments. In theatre, the production process itself often yields strong bonds – “surviving” a challenging tech week or celebrating a great opening night creates a camaraderie that outsiders might not fully get. Encourage these bonding moments and create additional ones outside of just show duties. One idea is to establish some traditions: for instance, always going out for drinks after the closing show, or an annual holiday party, or a silly awards night (“paper plate awards” for fun superlatives). These give members something to look forward to and reminisce about together. **Regular social gatherings** are especially important to knit the community together. This can include casual meetups like monthly pub nights, potluck dinners, or game nights that are purely social. A university volunteer guide wisely reminds organizers not to forget to _have fun_: “After a session, suggest a trip to a café or the pub, and organise regular socials for the volunteers”[14]. In practice, after a long rehearsal, you might say “Who’s up for a drink or late snack?” – those informal chats at the café can spark friendships.

Beyond unstructured socials, consider **community-building events** that relate to your mission. Some possibilities: - **Play Readings or Movie Nights:** Choose a play script to read aloud together (with everyone rotating roles for fun), or watch a recorded play/film and discuss. This is low pressure and open to all, and it deepens members’ appreciation of theatre while spending time together. ITCE’s new initiative explicitly lists _readings_ as a type of continuity event to keep members engaged between major productions[24].  
- **Improv Nights and Creative Jams:** Improv games are a fantastic icebreaker and equalizer – everyone can be silly together. Public improv drop-in sessions can attract new folks too. In fact, launching a repeatable improv workshop (demand-led and open to the public) is one strategy ITCE is using to bring in fresh faces and revenue while serving current members’ desire for regular creative outlet[27].  
- **Open Mic or Talent Showcase:** Give members (and friends) a chance to perform anything – a song, a monologue, stand-up comedy, etc. – in a supportive setting. This can reveal hidden talents and build respect among peers, plus it’s just fun.  
- **Volunteer “Field Trips”:** For example, organize a group outing to see a professional play or a local arts festival. Shared external experiences like this often spark bonding (“Remember when we all went to see _Hamilton_ and the train broke down?”). It positions the group as friends beyond just work.  
- **Community Service Projects:** It might sound counterintuitive (volunteers volunteering for something else?), but doing a charitable activity as a team can unite members under a positive cause. Perhaps the theatre group spends a day volunteering at a community center or hosts a charity performance for a local cause. People feel proud of their group’s values and enjoy giving back together, reinforcing emotional bonds and a collective identity.

Additionally, **celebrate personal milestones and successes**. A quick way to turn a loose association into a close-knit community is to treat members as whole people, not just “actors” or “crew.” Acknowledge birthdays, congratulate someone on a new job, or sympathize when someone’s family has a hardship. Some groups do a monthly newsletter or Facebook post “member spotlight” or life updates. The World Bank’s community toolkit suggests incorporating “water cooler” moments and personal celebrations (birthdays, etc.) into community life to create that family feeling[28]. For instance, if a long-time member is getting married, a bunch of theatre friends attending the wedding (or at least getting them a card/gift) really cements that this is more than an impersonal club. It goes without saying that genuine friendship cannot be forced, but you can set a tone of warmth and caring that lets friendships flourish.

**6. Maintain Engagement Between Productions:** Theatre organizations often run in cycles – an intense production period followed by a lull. To keep the community vibrant, fill those gaps with activity so people don’t drift away. The “Continuity Events” concept is exactly about this: schedule interim events like readings, improv nights, open rehearsals, or just socials _so there’s always something on the calendar_ for members to join[24]. This maintains momentum and keeps the sense of community continuity year-round[29][24]. For example, if your mainstage shows are fall and spring, make sure winter and summer have some workshops or gatherings. Even low-key things (e.g. a monthly script club or casual costume-making meetup) can prevent the feeling that the group only exists during show time. Consistency is key – weekly or monthly meetups create a rhythm that people can depend on. One community theatre realized a pain point was the gap between projects where everyone scatters; their strategy now is to coordinate programming so activities _“reinforce each other across the season, maintaining momentum and continuity for members”_[29]. The payoff is that when it’s time to cast or crew the next big show, you have a pool of folks who’ve remained active and feel connected, rather than having to start from scratch recruiting.

**7. Recognize and Empower Volunteers:** Never underestimate the power of appreciation. Thank your volunteers often and sincerely – in private and in public. This could mean a shout-out in the newsletter (“Kudos to Alex for organizing the prop closet last week!”), a small thank-you gift after a production, or an annual volunteer appreciation night. When people feel their work is noticed, they develop pride and loyalty to the group. Furthermore, empower those who are keen by **delegating meaningful responsibilities**. If a small core does everything, others might feel peripheral; instead, entrust volunteers with roles like leading a committee, managing an event, or mentoring newbies. Research on volunteer management advises getting used to delegation not only to lighten the leader’s load but to _“give volunteers more of a stake in the project”_[30]. For instance, if someone shows interest in marketing, let them handle social media for a season. Or have an experienced member direct a low-stakes one-act play as a showcase. This signals trust and helps members feel this is _their_ community too, not just something they observe. It also prepares future leaders from within the community, creating a sustainable cycle. When volunteers are given chances to grow and lead, they often rise to the occasion and stay committed longer[31].

**8. Build an Inclusive, Cross-Cultural Atmosphere:** Given the mix of expats and locals, it’s important to cultivate an environment where cultural differences are celebrated. Simple practices can help, like encouraging members to share traditions (maybe an international potluck where each person brings a dish from their homeland) or incorporating multicultural themes into your events. If most activities are in English, maybe occasionally having a fun segment where a Dutch member teaches the group a Dutch theatre phrase, or an expat teaches a greeting in their native language, can be icebreakers that honor diversity. Also be mindful of scheduling around major holidays of different cultures represented in your group (for example, international folks might travel home at certain times, etc.). When people feel that their identity is welcomed, they invest more in the group. In theatre art itself, you might choose plays or improv prompts that reflect various cultures or expat experiences, which can be very validating for members. One London-based migrant theatre collective found success by _not_ trying to erase differences but rather embracing them: they actively involved migrants of many backgrounds, made workshops multilingual and informal, and found that theatre’s collaborative nature helped “build true solidarity across demographics”[32][33]. Your community could consider projects that explore the expat experience or Dutch-international stories, thereby giving voice to members’ backgrounds. This not only engages those members deeply but can also attract audience interest and support from the broader international community in your area.

**9. Communication and Transparency:** Alongside events, the day-to-day communication practices can strengthen community. Keep members informed about what’s going on – via newsletters, group chats, or meetings – so they feel in the loop. Encourage dialogue, not just top-down announcements. For example, maintain an email list or WhatsApp group where any member can share opportunities or start a discussion (with moderation guidelines as needed). When people are informed, they feel included; when they’re asked for input on decisions or kept aware of plans, trust grows. Being transparent about the organization’s direction, challenges and successes builds a collective ownership. If planning a new initiative, involve the community in brainstorming (just like this research is a primer for a brainstorming session at ITC). This way, changes aren’t imposed from above; they emerge from the community’s involvement, which is itself a community-building process.

**10. Safe and Supportive Environment:** Finally, none of the fun stuff matters if people don’t feel psychologically safe. Community thrives on trust. Ensure that harassment, discrimination, or cliquish behavior is not tolerated. Set an example of positive, inclusive behavior. If conflicts arise, address them fairly. Encourage a mindset that we’re all here to support each other’s creative journeys, whether you’re a novice or a veteran. When members feel safe to take creative risks, to be themselves, and to fail and learn without judgment, the community bond deepens. This supportive culture will make people _want_ to stay involved because it feeds a basic human need for acceptance.

In summary, **building a sense of community is about designing an ecosystem where members feel a true sense of belonging, influence, fulfillment, and connection**. For an arts non-profit like an international theatre group, that means blending social activities with creative opportunities, and lowering barriers so that a wide range of people can engage. The practical ideas above – from buddy systems to improv nights to potlucks – are means to that end. It’s wise to mix and match tactics and see what resonates with your particular members. Also, continuously gather feedback and iterate. As the community grows, revisit these strategies: Are members still feeling heard? Do they want different events? Keep addressing those four needs (belonging, voice, benefit, bonding) and your membership will likely become not just participants, but passionate _advocates_ and friends. A thriving community doesn’t happen overnight, but with consistent effort, **active listening**, and a lot of heart, your theatre troupe can become a genuine home for those who join it. And when people feel at home, they’ll gladly put in the hours – whether on stage, behind the scenes, or at a Saturday social – to nurture and sustain that community. [28][14]
