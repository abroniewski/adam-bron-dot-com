In order to realise our mission, vision, and goals, and consequently establish ITCE as a leading force in international theatre and a bridge between cultural differences in the Brainport region we need, foremost, theatre and other theatre-related activities, such as workshops.

- This means that ITCE aims to perform a play every 9-12 months.
- Additionally, we aim to organise at least one acting course each year.

Based on past experiences, we have learned that we will need to decide which play to perform two years before we actually perform. This means that at this very moment in 2025, we are not only preparing our performance for autumn 2025, but also our already scheduled performance ‘The Visitors’ for May 2026, and on top of that we will initiate preparations for our play for 2027.
