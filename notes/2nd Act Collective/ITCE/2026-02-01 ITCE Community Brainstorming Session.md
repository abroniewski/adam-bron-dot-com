## 2. Key Discussion Points

### Context and framing

- ITCE is experiencing **growing ambition for more productions**, alongside a desire for a **more formalised community** that can support this growth.
    
- Central questions framing the session:
    
    - How do we make this work in practice?
        
    - How do we make it more sustainable?
        

### Mission & Vision review

- The current mission and vision were reviewed at a high level.
    
- The **focus was considered correct**, particularly around bridging differences.
    
- However, there was uncertainty around:
    
    - Scale and ambition.
        
    - Clarity of how ITCE actually “does” what it claims.
        
- A key gap identified was that **theatre-making is not explicit enough** in the mission, vision, and goals.
    

### Goals and strategic gaps

- Goals were reviewed with the following observations:
    
    - ITCE is largely “doing it already,” but not always naming or structuring it clearly.
        
    - While a platform exists, members do not consistently feel a sense of **membership or belonging**.
        
- Partnerships were identified as a major gap:
    
    - Strong relationships exist with funding bodies.
        
    - These relationships are not yet fully developed into true partnerships.
        
    - Non-funding partnerships (community, organisations, venues) are underdeveloped.
        

### Value proposition

- ITCE’s value proposition:
    
    - Exists and is communicated effectively for **funding purposes**.
        
    - Is **not well communicated externally** beyond funding.
        
    - Is **not clearly defined for actors and members**.
        
- There was agreement that ITCE needs to:
    
    - Communicate its value proposition more clearly.
        
    - Emphasise that ITCE are **theatre-makers**, not only a cultural bridge.
        

### Takeaways identified during the session

The group aligned on the following high-level takeaways:

1. Communicate ITCE’s value proposition more clearly.
    
2. Ensure members feel like members of a community.
    
3. Explicitly highlight ITCE as theatre-makers.
    
4. Develop partnerships beyond funding.
    
5. Work toward dedicated funding and collaborative advocacy.

## 3. Decisions

- [DECISION] ITCE has capacity **in principle** to support segmented or additional productions, provided proposals are evaluated case by case for timing and workload and brought formally to leadership and the board.
    
- [DECISION] A pitch for an additional production will be prepared and brought to the next leadership meeting.
    
- [DECISION] The Community Lead role exists as a **volunteer leadership role** with an evolving mandate.
    
- [DECISION] The primary mandate of the Community Lead is to:
    
    - Support members in developing ideas and initiatives.
        
    - Help package those ideas into light proposals appropriate for leadership or board consideration.
        
- [DECISION] Leadership and execution roles are clearly differentiated:
    
    - Artistic Director: volunteer leadership role; directing paid per contract.
        
    - Business Lead: paid per project; leadership representation voluntary.
        
    - Board members: volunteer and non-operational.
        
    - Community Lead: volunteer.
        
- [DECISION] ITCE will update the Mission, Vision, and Goals to:
    
    - Explicitly include theatre-making.
        
    - Improve clarity, while acknowledging overall strategic alignment is already correct.
        
- [DECISION] Sim will be invited to explore joining the leadership team in a volunteer capacity to support marketing.

## 4. Open Questions / Unresolved Items

- [UNCLEAR] How formal the partnership development effort should become versus remaining a shared, lightweight list.

If you want, the next clean step would be one of these:

- Extract a **Community Lead mandate + RACI** as a standalone artefact.
    
- Produce a **board-facing 1-page summary**.
    
- Turn the action items into a **30–60–90 day execution view**.
    

Say the word and I’ll do it cleanly.
