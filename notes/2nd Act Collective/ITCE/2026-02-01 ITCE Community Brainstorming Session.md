# ITCE Community Brainstorming Session

Date: 1 February 2026  
Time: 14:00–18:00

## 1. Meeting Overview

### Participants

Jan (Chair), Liz (Treasurer), Martijn (Secretary), Geert (Artistic Director), Marsha (Business Lead), Adam (Community Lead), Beata (member), Marlene (Production Lead)

### Purpose of the Meeting  
To align on ITCE’s direction and ambitions, review goals and mission/vision, identify gaps around community, partnerships, and sustainability, clarify roles and boundaries, and agree on practical next steps that are achievable within current capacity.

## 2. Key Discussion Points

### Context and framing

- ITCE is experiencing growing ambition for more productions, alongside a desire for a more formalised community that can support this growth.
- Central questions framing the session:
	- How do we make this work in practice?
    - How do we make it more sustainable?
    

### Mission & Vision review

- The current mission and vision were reviewed at a high level.
- The focus was considered correct, particularly around bridging differences.
- However, there was uncertainty around:
	- Scale and ambition.
	- Clarity of how ITCE actually “does” what it claims.

- A key gap identified was that theatre-making is not explicit enough in the mission, vision, and goals.
    

### Goals and strategic gaps

- Goals were reviewed with the following observations:
	- ITCE is largely “doing it already,” but not always naming or structuring it clearly.
	- While a platform exists, members do not consistently feel a sense of membership or belonging.

- Partnerships were identified as a major gap:
	- Strong relationships exist with funding bodies.
	- These relationships are not yet fully developed into true partnerships.
	- Non-funding partnerships (community, organisations, venues) are underdeveloped.

### Value proposition

- ITCE’s value proposition:
	- Exists and is communicated effectively for funding purposes.
	- Is not well communicated externally beyond funding.
	- Is not clearly defined for actors and members.

- There was agreement that ITCE needs to:
	- Communicate its value proposition more clearly.
	- Emphasise that ITCE are theatre-makers, not only a cultural bridge.

### Takeaways identified during the session

The group aligned on the following high-level takeaways:
	1. Communicate ITCE’s value proposition more clearly.
	2. Ensure members feel like members of a community.
	3. Explicitly highlight ITCE as theatre-makers.
	4. Develop partnerships beyond funding.
	5. Work toward dedicated funding and collaborative advocacy.


## 3. Decisions

- [DECISION] ITCE has capacity in principle to support segmented or additional productions, provided proposals are evaluated case by case for timing and workload and brought formally to leadership and the board.
- [DECISION] A pitch for an additional production will be prepared and brought to the next leadership meeting.
- [DECISION] The Community Lead role exists as a volunteer leadership role with an evolving mandate.
- [DECISION] The primary mandate of the Community Lead is to:

- Support members in developing ideas and initiatives.
- Help package those ideas into light proposals appropriate for leadership or board consideration.

- [DECISION] Leadership and execution roles are clearly differentiated. At a leadership level, all roles are volunteer.
	- Artistic Director: volunteer leadership role; directing paid per project.
	- Production Lead: volunteer leadership role; production assistant paid per project.
	- Business Lead: volunteer leadership role, business management paid per project.
	- Community Lead: volunteer leadership role.
	- Board members: volunteer and non-operational.

- [DECISION] Liz will update the Mission, Vision, and Goals to:
	- Explicitly include theatre-making.
	- Improve clarity, while acknowledging overall strategic alignment is already correct.

- [DECISION] Sem will be invited to explore joining the leadership team in a volunteer capacity to support marketing.
    

## 4. Open Questions / Unresolved Items

- [UNCLEAR] How individual contributions and member payments should be structured, and who owns this decision.
- [UNCLEAR] How formal the partnership development effort should become versus remaining a shared, lightweight list.
- [UNCLEAR] Long-term ownership of marketing leadership, given it is currently non-permanent and project-based.
