Considering the short-term objective of ITCE, we can summarise our mission as follows:

_ITCE's mission is to facilitate bridging cultural differences between Dutch and international residents of the Brainport region through the universal language of theatre._

Considering our short-term objective as well as our aspirations for the future, we can summarise our vision as follows:

_ITCE's vision is to contribute to the Brainport region’s transformation into an area where international and Dutch residents form a unified, interconnected community, moving beyond workplace relationships to create genuine cultural bonds and shared belonging._

This vision stems from the recognition that Eindhoven's and the Brainport region’s rapid growth necessitates efforts to foster genuine connections between newcomers and long-time residents.

ITCE aims to achieve this vision by positioning itself as a beacon of bridging cultural differences in the heart of the Brainport region. ITCE envisions a future where bridging cultural differences is prioritised, creating a more resilient and interconnected environment where diverse perspectives thrive. ITCE believes that by utilising English language theatre, we can break down barriers and foster understanding between Dutch and international residents, ultimately leading to a model of cultural harmony and innovation.

ITCE's methodology goes beyond traditional theatre by:

- Employing interactive, multidisciplinary performances that address contemporary issues
- Organising workshops and events that facilitate direct interaction between Dutch and international residents
- Collaborating with local cultural institutions to amplify impact
