## Context

**The Visitors**  
Rehearsal weekend 1

This note captures early observations and feedback from the Community & Development pilot during the first rehearsal weekend. It documents lightweight, informal interventions that supported group dynamics and alignment with the pilot’s intent.

---

## Purpose of this artefact

- Capture concrete, community-supporting actions and observations.
- Document informal, lightweight interventions aligned with the pilot intent.
- Create a reference point for later reflection and evaluation.

---

## 1. Opening emotional check-in

### What happened
- The rehearsal opened with a check-in on how people were feeling.
- Participants shared openly, with visible vulnerability.

### Observed impact
- Barriers between participants dropped quickly.
- The room moved faster into a sense of shared trust and safety.
- People appeared more comfortable taking up space early on.

### Why this matters
- Psychological safety supports creative risk-taking.
- Early trust formation reduces social hesitation later in the process.
- Particularly valuable in groups with mixed experience levels.

### Note
- This was perceived as grounding and unifying.
- A simple intervention with high relational impact.

## 2. Informal ensemble coaching and contextual support

### Context
- Beata attended rehearsal in a non-acting role.
- This created space for focused attention on ensemble members.

### What happened
- Informal coaching and explanation during breaks and downtime.
- Context was provided on:
  - How to think about the ensemble role.
  - What to watch for while scenes were being developed.
  - How to prepare, stay engaged, and improvise meaningfully.

### Observed impact
- Ensemble members gained clarity and confidence.
- Roles felt more purposeful, not passive.
- Especially supportive for participants with little or no theatre experience.

### Why this matters
- Newcomers often lack implicit theatre knowledge.
- Without context, uncertainty can lead to disengagement.
- Embedded, in-the-moment learning supports confidence without pressure.

## 3. Learning embedded in practice

### Observation
- Informal guidance during rehearsal felt more effective than separating newcomers for formal instruction.

### Why
- Learning was immediately applicable.
- Avoided creating an “experienced vs inexperienced” divide.
- Supported inclusion without spotlighting gaps in knowledge.

### Implication
- Embedded learning aligns well with this group and context.
- Formalisation may not be necessary to achieve clarity and confidence.

## 4. Rehearsal structure and group dynamics

### Observation
- A longer rehearsal format early on accelerated group bonding.
- Extended shared time created more natural touchpoints:
  - Breaks
  - Conversations
  - Orientation to the space
  - Informal connection

### Observed impact
- Group dynamics developed more quickly than in shorter sessions.
- People became comfortable with the space and with each other.
- Momentum and cohesion were established early.

### Emerging insight
A possible structure for future productions could be:
- An initial weeknight rehearsal for script reading.
- Followed shortly by a longer Saturday session.

This provides both efficiency and space for bonding.  
This is an observation, not a recommendation at this stage.

## 5. Buddy system — participant feedback

### Feedback source
- Santkop, returning ITCE actor.

### What he shared
- He responded positively to the buddy system.
- He noticed that:
  - Everyone appeared to be talking with everyone else.
  - The system gave him a clear reason to approach someone new.
- He spoke with someone he otherwise would not have engaged with and discovered:
  - They had solid acting experience.
  - They were interesting and enjoyable to talk to.

### Why this matters
- The buddy system:
  - Reduced social friction.
  - Encouraged intentional cross-connection.
  - Supported integration beyond existing relationships.
- It benefitted both newcomers and returning members.

---

## 6. Meta observation

- None of these actions were heavily planned or formalised.
- They were responsive to what the room needed in the moment.
- Their impact came from timing, presence, and care, not structure.

This aligns with the pilot intent:
- Small, human-scale interventions.
- Focus on belonging, clarity, and confidence.
- Creating conditions for people to connect naturally and early.

---

## Summary snapshot

**What is working so far:**
- Early emotional grounding.
- Informal, embedded guidance.
- Longer early touchpoints.
- Light structure that enables connection without forcing it.
- Buddy system lowering social barriers for both new and returning members.

This artefact reflects what has already happened, not future commitments.
