## 0) At‑a‑Glance (fill last)

**Working tagline:** Community‑first theatre for Brainport: popular shows that fund bold work.  
**What we do:** Run productions, workshops, and production‑track training that build a lasting theatre community.  
**Who it’s for:** Amateur & semi‑pro actors, production makers (set/costume/tech/music), Dutch & international audiences, and corporate teams.  
**Where/when:** Eindhoven / Brainport region; year‑round portfolio (parallel classics + art‑advancing work; rolling workshops).  
**Why now:** Partnering **inside ITCE** lowers risk (established contacts, digital presence, discounted halls, **€20k buffer**). We can build on real demand from _Pride & Prejudice_ and repeatable workshop interest.  
**Proof so far:** _Pride & Prejudice_ ran **3 mid‑week sold‑out nights (110 seats each) booked out ~3 months ahead**, with a **growing waitlist**. Beata’s **improv workshop** was well reviewed with high demand for repeat. We’ve collected extensive community feedback (actors, participants, ITCE members). **Current ITCE shows:** _Pinter_ (upcoming); **next year:** _The Visitors_ (ITCE; auditions now).  
**The ask (for this audience):** Approve **two workshops** (incl. a repeat improv workshop), a **P&P re‑mount**, and development/production of a **new play: Northanger Abbey** (working title).

## 1) Problem & Insight

**Target segments**

- ✓ Amateur/semi‑pro actors seeking craft, continuity, and belonging
    
- ✓ Makers & crew (set, costume, hair/makeup, backstage, music) wanting a way in
    
- ✓ Local Dutch & international audiences (strong pull to accessible classics)
    
- ✓ Corporate teams (experiential learning)
    

**Jobs-to-be-done (top 3)**

1. Provide a **reliable path to participate** (onstage and behind the scenes) with consistent opportunities across the year.
    
2. Offer **approachable, larger‑cast classics** that build community and audience, in parallel with **art‑advancing** productions.
    
3. Enable **skills growth** through workshops so members with fewer lines or less experience still gain value and stay engaged.
    

**Observed pains / constraints**

- Limited paths for non‑actors/crew; ad‑hoc intake makes it hard to join and contribute meaningfully.
    
- **Scheduling barriers**: some members can’t rehearse on the chosen weekday; lack of varied time scales (drop‑in/weekend) excludes many.
    
- Operational friction around **mission/vision/values** execution; decisions feel inconsistent at times.
    
- Marketing challenge for English‑language, high‑brow titles to Dutch audiences; classics are easier to sell.
    

**Desired gains**

- A **portfolio** where classics (bigger casts, lighter themes) build community + ticket income, which **cross‑subsidizes** riskier, message‑driven work.
    
- **Production‑track involvement** (set, costume, tech, music, backstage) with training and recognition.
    
- **Varied scheduling** (drop‑in, weekend intensives, different weekdays) to broaden access and retention.
    
- A more **professional, consistent operating cadence** aligned with stated values.
    

**Evidence log (highlights)**

- _P&P_ 3×110 **sold out** ~3 months in advance; **waitlist** indicates unmet demand.
    
- **Improv workshop** (Beata) received strong reviews; demand for repeats.
    
- Community feedback gathered across actors/participants/ITCE members (what’s missing: non‑actor paths; schedule variety; clearer ops).
    
- ITCE context: _Pinter_ currently in production; _The Visitors_ scheduled next year with auditions underway.

## 2) Our Proposition

**Core offering (portfolio)**

- **Productions (parallel):**
    
    - **Popular classics** with **larger casts** and approachable themes (e.g., **Pride & Prejudice** re‑mount) to maximize community participation and ticketability.
        
    - **New work** that advances the art and message (e.g., **Northanger Abbey**, working title), staged alongside classics so each informs and supports the other.
        
- **Workshops & bootcamps:** Repeat **improv** (Beata) and add **ensemble/scene study**; introduce **production‑skills workshops** (set, costume, hair/makeup, tech, music). Formats include **drop‑in evenings** and **weekend intensives** to widen access and upskill ensembles/extras.
    
- **Talent pipeline:** Clear paths for **actors and makers** (assistant roles, apprenticeships) so members grow into key roles.
    

**How we address needs**

- **Community & access:** Classics with bigger casts + varied workshop formats keep more members active more often.
    
- **Skills development:** Training doubles as **rehearsal support** for large ensembles/extras and builds a deeper bench for challenging productions.
    
- **Operational leverage:** Operating **within ITCE** uses its contacts, digital presence, discounted halls, and **€20k buffer** to lower risk and speed execution.
    

**Differentiators**

- A **portfolio engine** (classics → revenue + community; new work → artistic edge) integrated with **production‑track pathways**.
    
- Pragmatic partnership with **ITCE** to de‑risk and scale faster, while preserving an option to **spin out** if alignment stalls.
    

**Success metrics**

- Seats sold, **waitlist size**, occupancy %, repeat attendance.
    
- Workshop fill rate, satisfaction, repeat sign‑ups, **production‑track uptake**.
    
- Member retention/participation across roles; contribution of classics to **cross‑subsidy** for art‑advancing work.

## 5) Governance, Culture & Operating Model

**Operating model (inside ITCE vs spin‑out)**

- Current mode: **inside ITCE** to leverage contacts, digital presence, discounted halls, and **€20k buffer**.
    
- Spin‑out decision driver: whether we can **operate smoothly within ITCE** with aligned communication and approach; if pros stop outweighing cons, we **spin out**.
    

**Team & roles**

- Core team: **Beata, Renske, Adam, Liz**.
    
- Current ITCE director collaborator: **Geert** (ITCE production).
    
- Suggested scopes: **Beata — Artistic/Directing & training; Renske — Producing & partnerships; Adam — Operations & governance alignment (mission/vision/values); Liz — Marketing & case studies.**
    
- Cadence: **monthly ops**; concise director/producer updates (progress, risks, budget status); clear decision logs.
    

**Professional standards & wellbeing**

- Maintain a **safe, professional rehearsal environment** and clear reporting/feedback norms without over‑proceduralizing.
    
- Use **feedback instruments** (actor & audience forms) to guide continuous improvement.
    

**Working files**

- Private ITCE drive for budgets, calendars, decision logs; share audience‑facing assets via ITCE channels.

## 9) Messaging Library (copy blocks)

**Problem (short):** Talented people want to make theatre year‑round, but entry points are narrow, rehearsal schedules exclude many, and high‑brow English shows are harder to sell. Non‑actors lack a way in, so the community and talent pool don’t grow.

**Solution (short):** Build a **portfolio engine** inside ITCE: run **larger‑cast popular classics** (easy to attend, community‑building, ticketable) **in parallel** with **new work** that advances the art. Use **workshops**—acting and **production‑skills**—to upskill members, keep them engaged between roles, and supply ensembles/extras.

**Why now:** _P&P_ sold out 3×110 mid‑week ~3 months early, with a waitlist. Beata’s improv workshop has demand to repeat. ITCE’s contacts, digital presence, discounted halls, and **€20k buffer** reduce startup risk and speed execution.

**Traction proof:**

- _P&P_: proven sell‑through and waitlist; re‑mount planned.
    
- Workshops: improv run with strong reviews; repeat planned; production‑skills modules in development.
    
- Community feedback: demand for schedule variety and non‑actor paths.
    

**One‑minute pitch script:**

> Eindhoven’s theatre community is ready to grow—but people need more ways to take part. The **2nd Act Collective** partners with **ITCE** to run **larger‑cast classics** that sell and bring people in, alongside **new work** that pushes the art. We keep members engaged with **acting and production‑skills workshops**, so even those with smaller roles are learning and contributing. Demand is clear: _Pride & Prejudice_ sold out **3×110 mid‑week** months early with a waitlist, and our improv workshop has people asking for more. Inside ITCE we benefit from contacts, promo channels, discounted halls, and a **€20k buffer**—so we can start fast with low risk. Our ask today: approve **two workshops**, a **P&P re‑mount**, and **Northanger Abbey** in development. Together we’ll grow a bigger, stronger community and create space for braver theatre.
