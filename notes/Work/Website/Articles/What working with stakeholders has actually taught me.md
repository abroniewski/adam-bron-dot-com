### What working with stakeholders has actually taught me

I joined Konekti in August as a customer success manager, reasonably confident that I understood consultative sales.

I knew how to ask questions. I knew how to talk about value. I knew how to “manage stakeholders”.

What I didn’t realise was how thin that understanding still was.

The last few months have been less about learning new techniques and more about unlearning a bad assumption: that stakeholder work is mainly about persuasion.

It isn’t.

It’s about helping people move without getting hurt.

And that turns out to matter far beyond sales.

### Nobody is deciding on the thing you think they are

Early on, I spent a lot of energy getting better at explaining what we do. How it works. Why it’s sensible. Why it’s worth the effort.

That helped less than I expected.

What actually moved conversations forward was recognising that most stakeholders weren’t evaluating the solution at all. They were evaluating _exposure_.

Who gets blamed if this fails?  
Who has to clean up the mess if adoption is poor?  
Who suddenly owns more work than they have capacity for?

You see this in sales. You see it in internal projects. You definitely see it in non-profits, where nobody has formal authority but everyone still has reputational risk.

Until you address that layer, the rest is noise.

### Stakeholders don’t act alone, even when they pretend to

One mistake I made early was treating stakeholders as separate conversations.

If I got alignment with each person individually, I assumed the group would move.

It often didn’t.

What I missed is that people take cues from each other. They wait to see who sticks their head above the parapet first. They look for cover.

Someone being “supportive” in a one-to-one means very little if they aren’t willing to be visibly supportive when it counts.

Once I started paying attention to those dynamics, a lot of confusing situations stopped being confusing.

Nothing was “stuck”. It was just socially unsafe to move.

### Resistance is usually self-preservation

I used to interpret pushback as disagreement.

Now I’m much more suspicious of that explanation.

Most resistance I’ve encountered comes from people trying not to get burned. Security teams worrying about exposure. Delivery teams worried about unrealistic expectations. Leaders worried about being attached to something that might quietly fail.

Arguing benefits into that doesn’t work. It can actually make things worse.

What helps is naming the risk out loud and treating it as legitimate, not inconvenient.

That applies whether you’re selling software or asking a group of volunteers to commit to a new way of working.

### Shared understanding beats perfect answers

I’ve also learned to stop over-optimising for “having the answer”.

Groups don’t need perfection. They need coherence.

When stakeholders don’t share the same story about what problem they’re solving, why it matters now, and what happens next, alignment evaporates later. Usually at exactly the wrong moment.

Protecting a single, repeatable narrative has turned out to be far more valuable than being clever in meetings.

If people can’t explain the decision to someone else, the decision isn’t real yet.

---

### Momentum is behavioural, not emotional

This one took me longer than I’d like to admit.

Good meetings feel productive. They aren’t.

What matters is what someone is willing to do afterwards. Introduce you. Share internal material. Put time on a calendar. Attach their name to a next step.

Across sales, projects, and non-profit work, the absence of those small commitments is diagnostic. Either the risk hasn’t been dealt with, or the decision isn’t actually owned.

Learning to read that signal has made me much more honest about where things stand.

---

### Trust is built through follow-through, not warmth

I still care about relationships. But I no longer confuse rapport with trust.

Trust comes from being predictable. From saying when something is risky. From not disappearing when things get awkward. From making other people’s decisions easier to defend.

You can be perfectly pleasant and still not trusted with real outcomes.

This has been one of the more sobering lessons.

### Influence has a line, and you cross it faster than you think

One thing I’m increasingly careful about is how influence is used.

It’s very easy to manufacture urgency, smooth over trade-offs, or apply pressure that looks like “help”.

Short term, that can work. Longer term, it erodes the very thing stakeholder work depends on.

A simple check helps me here: would I be comfortable explaining my approach to the other side afterwards?

If not, something’s off.

That standard matters everywhere, but especially in environments where you have to keep working with the same people long after the decision is made.

---

### The shift I’m trying to hold onto

If I had to reduce the last few months to one useful shift, it would be this:

My role isn’t to convince people.  
It’s to make decisions safer for them to make.

Sometimes that leads to a yes. Sometimes it leads to a no that arrives earlier and cleaner.

Both are better than false alignment.

I don’t think this is a sales lesson, really. It’s a coordination lesson. And it’s one I expect to keep relearning, just with more complexity and higher stakes.

If you want, next we can:

- Tune this further for LinkedIn vs blog
    
- Add one concrete anonymised anecdote to increase “human noise”
    
- Deliberately roughen the prose even more for anti-detector safety
    

Just say where you want to push it.
