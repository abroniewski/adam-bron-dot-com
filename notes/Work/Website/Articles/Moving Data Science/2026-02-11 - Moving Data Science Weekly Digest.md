# Moving Data Science
## Weekly draft for LinkedIn (Version 3, decision-maker emphasis)
**Date:** 11 February 2026  
**Read time:** 5 minutes

### Weekly thesis
Enterprise AI is entering an execution phase where budget control, process clarity, and governance design matter more than model novelty.

## Signals this week

### 1) Multi-year partnerships are replacing pilot-era buying patterns
Reuters reports a five-year AI partnership between Google Cloud and Liberty Global, alongside a separate Reuters report on the $200 million Snowflake-OpenAI partnership focused on enterprise AI services.

For decision-makers, this is less about headline size and more about procurement intent. Large organisations are signalling they want durable stack choices that support multi-year operating change. That creates second-order decisions around integration standards, ownership boundaries, and vendor concentration risk.

**Practical implication:** move from fragmented proof-of-concept funding to a staged portfolio plan with explicit platform, data, and accountability choices.

### 2) Process context is moving into the interface layer
SAP announced general availability for Joule with SAP Signavio, bringing process context and improvement actions into conversational workflows.

This matters because many enterprise assistants can generate text but cannot reliably support cross-functional execution. Process context helps teams identify where work stalls, who owns the handoff, and where change should be prioritised.

**Practical implication:** prioritise AI interfaces that are linked to process artefacts and ownership models, not standalone chat-only tools.

### 3) Process intelligence is being positioned as AI infrastructure
Celonis used WEF Davos 2026 to reinforce an open ecosystem narrative around process intelligence as context for enterprise AI outcomes.

Vendor framing will differ, but the core operating point is credible. If agents do not have visibility into real workflow dependencies across systems, they can accelerate local tasks while failing to improve end-to-end performance.

**Practical implication:** treat process intelligence as part of execution architecture, alongside data, model, and governance layers.

### 4) Investment scrutiny is hardening
Forrester's 2026 predictions point to tighter budget discipline and stronger pressure for evidenced returns. Gartner adds a long-term caution on customer service unit economics, noting that GenAI resolution cost may exceed offshore human-agent cost in some scenarios by 2030.

The message is not anti-AI. It is pro-accountability. Boards and CFOs are now looking for clearer evidence loops, with specific baselines, target outcomes, and timing assumptions.

**Practical implication:** require each AI initiative to include baseline metrics, value hypothesis, risk assumptions, and pre-agreed stop-or-scale criteria.

### 5) A practical case signal: process intelligence linked to transformation outcomes
A Process Excellence Network report on Fujitsu and Celonis gives a case-style signal that process intelligence is being used to support AI transformation with operational objectives.

Case reports are directional evidence, but useful because they anchor strategy in workflow-level execution.

**Practical implication:** include at least one real process case in internal steering reviews so investment decisions are grounded in implementation evidence.

## Why it matters for enterprise teams

The 2026 divide is unlikely to be adopters versus non-adopters. It is more likely to be disciplined operators versus teams still optimising for experimentation volume.

Disciplined operators are making five choices consistently:
1. They fund fewer initiatives, but with explicit value metrics.
2. They define governance controls before broad rollout.
3. They assign named owners for data quality and process conformance.
4. They instrument bottlenecks before automating them.
5. They sequence scaling by evidence, not by internal enthusiasm.

**Practical implication:** run AI as an operating model programme, not a collection of disconnected technology experiments.

## Process mining lens

Agentic AI often assumes that better reasoning automatically produces better operations. In enterprise settings, that assumption fails when teams cannot see how work actually flows.

Process mining and process intelligence improve this by answering three operational questions:

1. **Where does work actually move, and where does it stall?**  
Event-level data reveals queue delays, rework loops, and handoff friction.

2. **What is conformant execution, and where does drift occur?**  
Conformance analysis shows the gap between designed process and observed behaviour.

3. **Which bottlenecks are economics-critical first?**  
Not all bottlenecks justify AI intervention. Some require policy simplification, data remediation, or ownership clarification first.

A weekly bottleneck metric to watch: **rework rate at cross-functional handoff points**. If rework remains high, agent quality alone will not produce sustained throughput gains.

**Practical implication:** before scaling any agentic workflow, map one end-to-end process with event visibility and choose three bottlenecks to attack in sequence.

## What to do in the next 30 days

Use a decision-maker sprint that can be completed in one month.

1. **Choose one workflow with economic significance**  
Examples: claims triage, order-to-cash exceptions, service resolution escalations.

2. **Set baseline and target metrics**  
Track cycle time, exception rate, rework rate, and unit cost.

3. **Define human-agent control boundaries**  
Specify where autonomy is allowed, where approval is required, and where escalation is mandatory.

4. **Install a lightweight governance gate**  
Require checks for traceability, data quality, fallback path, accountable owner, and compliance exposure.

5. **Run a limited production cohort**  
Use one business unit, one region, or one product line to reduce change risk.

6. **Decide at day 30 using evidence**  
Scale, redesign, or stop based on observed outcomes versus baseline.

**Practical implication:** this creates an auditable path from strategy narrative to operational evidence.

## Closing thought

The market still rewards AI storytelling, but enterprise value is now decided by process visibility, governance quality, and financial discipline.

Teams that perform best in 2026 are likely to be those that design clear control points, measure operational outcomes, and make scaling decisions only when evidence supports them.

**Practical implication:** if your next AI investment decision cannot be defended with process metrics and ownership clarity, it is not ready to scale.
