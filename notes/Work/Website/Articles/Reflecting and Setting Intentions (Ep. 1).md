# Reflecting and Setting Intentions (Ep. 1)

Coming to the end of a year always feels like the right time to reflect. This year, my wife and I got out to a little [wood-stove heated cabin](https://www.hillsidechalets.com/) near Golden, BC. I tried an [80/20 approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) to reflect and set my intention for next year and looked for ways to keep focused through the year.

All of my intentions for the upcoming year are associated with a clear [why statement](https://www.audible.ca/pd/Start-with-Why-Audiobook/B074VDQBFS?source_code=GDGGBRF0814170003&ipRedirectOverride=true&gclid=CjwKCAiAirb_BRBNEiwALHlnD66zXqHAF2SHVQ4DUt0lrP-JjLV7mfBLlQE6l-5egf0JW6F7JFF-HhoCduAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). This has made it simple to see if the activities I am pursuing are actually associated with things I value. My "buckets" of intention include: health, family, relationships, career, community, fun, spirituality and mental health, and finance.

## how i reflected on 2020

I scrolled through my 2020 calendar and put things into a ["positive" and "negative" list](https://tim.blog/2018/12/28/past-year-review/). Going through and finding trends, I looked at what 20% of my activities brought me the most joy (and what 20% brought the most frustration). My focus for the upcoming year will be to do more of the positive and avoid the negative like the plague.

## LEARNING

### r programming

As I prepare to apply for a Master's in [Big Data Management Analytics](https://bdma.ulb.ac.be/bdma/), I developed a curriculum for myself to close the gap between where I am and what I need for the program. This past couple weeks I've been learning R through data camp. Check out the [Data Scientist Career Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-r) or [Coursera's IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&campaignid=2087860785&utm_campaign=10-IBM-Data-Science-ROW&utm_content=10-IBM-Data-Science-ROW&adgroupid=79675709431&device=c&keyword=ibm+data+science+coursera&matchtype=p&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=375774778792&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAiAirb_BRBNEiwALHlnD6hKBJ57RpIZUuct1_wXp0g8qeFCeOTzk9siWcOztO0j9XyuzJq4XxoClowQAvD_BwE)

After in unnecessary amount of research into the world of EDC, I got myself a [small pocket knife](https://www.swissarmy.com/ca/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/Medium-Pocket-Knives/Cadet-Alox/p/0.2601.26) that I committed to carrying. It's true, once you have a knife, you can't go back.
