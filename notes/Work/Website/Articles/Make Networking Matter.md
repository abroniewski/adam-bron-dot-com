# Make Networking Matter

# Landing an Interview

Meeting new people in a professional setting and selling yourself without looking like an egomaniac can be tough to pull off. Over the next couple of weeks, I'll share the most important things to know when networking to find a job. If you've got the right tools, and you understand what you're getting into, networking can actually be a really fun challenge; pushing you outside of your comfort zone.

## Know the company.

_Check out the company website and Google News._

Learn about the company's values, their internship or rotational program structure, geographic locations, and company operations. Make sure you **know what makes this company different** from its competitors.

Your best resource to know the company and show that you are up to date with the latest is to do a quick search on [Google News](https://news.google.ca/). This will quickly pull up all the latest articles and show you what the company has been up to in the recent weeks.

You want to know these basics for two reasons:

·         It shows that you care enough to put some time into the company and do your research.

·         It **sets you apart from everyone else** asking about this stuff, and gives you time to focus on more important topics that you can't find on the website.

## Know what you are looking for.

In this respect, it is important to develop an idea about what your long-term goals are, what type of work you want to be doing, what kind of experiences you want to have, and what things you value in company culture (community involvement, environmental awareness, volunteering opportunities etc.).

You may not have all of this figured out right away, and that is OK. The whole point of networking is to figure this out. Being real and honest about these topics when you're talking with people is what will set you apart from the rest of the crowd.

## Be yourself.

_Stand out from the crowd._

It's important to be cognizant of the fact that the people you are speaking with have been networking with hundreds of other people. They can see right through people that are being insincere are trying to "get ahead". 

If the people you are talking with don't like what they see, don't like the real you, that is great! **It's better to know that you won't be a good fit now**, rather than going through the application and interview process and landing a job you don't like working with people you hate. Talk about what YOU truly want, not what you think people want to hear, it will be more fulfilling in the long-run.

_I once showed up to a "prestigious" networking event where everyone is decked out in full suits and I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. For me, this was a good move for two reasons. Firstly, it made me feel really comfortable talking with people. I wasn't in an uncomfortable suit, and was able to treat the entire situation much more casually. Secondly, it made me stand out. I was the only person in the room NOT wearing a suit. For me, that gave me a huge boost in confidence, because I enjoy standing out and being different. This isn't something I recommend for everyone, and it may not always work, but it was right for me at the time. I should also note that I ended up getting through 2 rounds of interviews and landing an offer with that company._

What have you done at networking events to stand out?

## Build rapport.

_Connect in a meaningful way._

This can mean talking about something outside of the norm, or diving really deep into a particular subject. Whatever it is, make sure you build rapport with the people you are talking to and **have a meaningful conversation**.

_I once got into a really great conversation about the ethics of business decisions with a guy from a management consulting firm. I had reached the "end" of the networking, and felt I had gotten all the information I wanted about the company, so I felt comfortable talking about a completely unrelated subject. It was a very real conversation, in that it wasn't forced, I wasn't trying to prove myself to this person, and I was genuinely interested in the conversation topic._

## Follow up.

_Get their business card._

Once you've built rapport and gotten some questions answered, politely let them know that there are some other people in the room you'd like to meet, but that you would like to get together and pick their brain about XYZ. Then ask for their business card. This has always worked for me as a good transition between different people, and it gives an actual reason for them to hand over their contact info and for you to get in touch.

Send a follow up email thanking them for their time. The people that come to these networking events enjoy meeting with others and talking about themselves, so they will usually be receptive to an invitation to meet and chat in person.

## Go for coffee.

_Meeting one-on-one in person is without parallel._

Treat this as an information interview. You get to ask this person absolutely anything you want about the company, the industry, the application process, what to put on the cover letter and resume, what the company culture is like, what their career path has been.

**The coffee date also acts as an informal interview.** If the person likes you and thinks you will be good for the company, they can act as "champions" for you within the company, helping you along in the process, talking to the right people, and making sure you have the opportunities to showcase your skills in an interview.

Go for as many one-on-one meetings as possible.

## Enjoy the process.

_Networking is an amazing opportunity to learn about yourself both professionally and personally._

Networking will push you outside of your comfort zone to approach people you've never met and strike up a conversation. You will be most definitely be faced with some awkward moments, but as you network more and more, these moments will disappear, and you will be able to move through a room with confidence and ease.

What kind of experiences have you had at networking events? Ever try something outside the box that didn't work? Do you have some go-to strategies that work every time?
