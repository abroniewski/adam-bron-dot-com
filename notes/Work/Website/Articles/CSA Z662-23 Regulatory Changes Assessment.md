# Changes Between CSA Z662:19 and CSA Z662:23 – Integrity Management Focus

## Introduction

The Canadian Standards Association’s **CSA Z662** standard for Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems was updated from the 2019 edition to a new 2023 edition. This update introduced significant changes affecting pipeline **integrity management** practices, especially for transmission pipelines. The new edition takes a more comprehensive lifecycle approach to safety and integrity, adding new technical requirements and clarifying existing ones. Below is a detailed comparison of key updates between CSA Z662:19 and CSA Z662:23, with emphasis on integrity management, compliance obligations, impacts on engineering workload, and the expertise needed to meet the new requirements.

## Major Revisions Impacting Integrity Management Practices

Several revisions in CSA Z662:23 directly influence how pipeline operators manage the integrity and safety of transmission pipelines over their lifespan:

- **Enhanced Risk Assessment Requirements:** **Annex B** (Guidelines for Risk Assessment of Pipelines) was significantly revised in the 2023 edition. It now provides **more detailed requirements for performing risk assessments** and even introduces **quantitative risk acceptance criteria for both safety and environmental risks** ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=mitigation) ). This means operators must evaluate pipeline risks with a more rigorous and measurable approach, ensuring that risks to public safety and the environment are kept below defined thresholds.
    
- **Updated Integrity Management Program Guidelines:** **Annex N** (Guidelines for Pipeline System Integrity Management Programs) was revised to align with the new risk assessment approach in Annex B ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=j,for%20safety%20and%20environmental%20risks) ). Integrity management programs (IMPs) are expected to incorporate the enhanced risk assessment process and criteria. In practice, this pushes operators to integrate risk-based decision-making into their integrity programs – for example, by prioritizing inspections and mitigations based on quantified risk levels for pipeline segments. The IMP must now address the full pipeline life cycle with methods for collecting, integrating, and analyzing data on design, construction, operation, maintenance, and failure incidents to continuously improve safety ([Pipeline Compliance Standards Summary Checklist](https://www.tssa.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/Pipeline%20Compliance%20Standard%20Summary%20Checklist-Pipeline%20Owners%20%26%20Operators-Fuels-Checklist.pdf#:~:text=Integrity%20Management%20Program%20CSA%20Z662,monitoring%20%E2%80%A2%20Maintenance%20and%20repair)).
    
- **Safety Class-Based Design Approach:** CSA Z662:23 introduces an alternative **“safety class” system** for design, as a complement to the traditional location class system. **Annex C** was revised to include a risk-informed _Safety Class designation_ method for selecting design factors ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=ii,the%20maximum%20allowable%20hoop%20stress) ). Clause 4 (Design) and Clause 10 were updated to permit pressure design based on this safety class approach ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=e) ). In essence, pipelines can be designed using safety classes derived from risk levels (for certain fluid service categories) instead of solely population-based location classes. Each safety class maps to an equivalent location class for applying other code provisions ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=a%20selection%20of%20service%20fluids,the%20maximum%20allowable%20hoop%20stress) ). This revision impacts integrity management by encouraging a **risk-consistent design** philosophy – higher-risk pipelines (e.g. higher consequence areas) would be designed more conservatively. It ties the design phase more closely to lifecycle integrity considerations (since safety class is determined by evaluating potential failure consequences and probabilities). Operators may choose this method to achieve a more tailored safety level for different segments of a transmission line.
    
- **Lifecycle Hazard Management on Right-of-Way:** New content was added in **Clause 10** of Z662:23 to provide clearer and more prescriptive requirements for managing hazards on the pipeline **right-of-way (ROW)** on a continuous basis ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=g,hazards%20to%20the%20pipeline%20system) ). Integrity management now explicitly requires operators to **proactively monitor and control potential hazards along the pipeline route**, such as geotechnical threats (landslides, erosion), encroachments, or unauthorized activities. This ensures that threats to pipeline integrity are identified and mitigated before they can cause failures. The 2019 edition had general provisions for monitoring and maintenance, but the 2023 update strengthens expectations, making it clear that maintaining ROW integrity (e.g. through patrols, signage, vegetation management, and threat removal) is an essential ongoing practice.
    
- **Cross-Bore Mitigation Requirements:** CSA Z662:23 introduces **new provisions to address cross bores** – instances where a new pipeline is unintentionally drilled through an existing underground utility (often a sewer or drain line). Additional content in Clause 12 of the new edition specifically requires operators to implement **cross-bore mitigation measures** ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=test%20reports%20for%20all%20steel,pipe%20and%20components) ). This is particularly relevant for distribution pipelines and any transmission lines installed via horizontal directional drilling in developed areas. The integrity management implication is that companies must now include procedures to prevent, detect, and eliminate cross bores as part of their planning and integrity programs, reducing the risk of later failures or safety incidents caused by these conflicts.
    
- **Material Traceability and Record Retention:** The 2023 standard places greater emphasis on material traceability as an integrity measure. **Clause 12.5.7** was aligned with Clause 5.7.1 to mandate more **prescriptive record retention requirements**, including the retention of **material test reports (MTRs) for all steel pipe and components** ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=h%29%20Clause%2012,all%20steel%20pipe%20and%20components) ). In fact, a **new explicit requirement** was added in Z662:23 that operators must obtain and retain MTRs for all pipe and components used ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=m,reports%20for%20pipe%20and%20components) ). In CSA Z662:19, recordkeeping was good practice, but the new edition makes it a clear requirement. This change improves integrity management by ensuring that complete material property data is available for the life of the pipeline – critical if you need to evaluate component integrity, assess fitness for service, or investigate failures. Operators will need robust document control processes as part of their integrity programs to comply with this requirement.
    
- **Integration of Hydrogen Pipeline Systems:** One of the headline changes in CSA Z662:23 is the **addition of an entirely new clause on hydrogen** service. **Clause 17** in the 2019 edition (which had covered composite reinforced steel pipelines) was deleted, and a **new Clause 17 on hydrogen and hydrogen blend pipeline systems** was introduced ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=c,pipeline%20systems%2C%20has%20been%20added) ). The scope of CSA Z662 was explicitly updated to confirm that **pipelines carrying hydrogen or hydrogen-natural gas blends are within the standard’s coverage**, and that “renewable gas” (e.g. renewable natural gas, biogas) is treated equivalently to conventional gas ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=d,gas) ). Numerous changes were made throughout the standard to accommodate the **unique design, material, construction, and operational requirements** for pipelines containing hydrogen ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=ii,requirements%20into%20this%20Standard%3B%20and) ). From an integrity management perspective, this is a major extension of scope – pipeline operators dealing with hydrogen must now manage new integrity threats such as hydrogen embrittlement, hydrogen-assisted cracking, and permeability issues. The standard provides requirements and guidance for these issues, but operators will need to incorporate them into integrity management programs for any transmission pipelines transporting hydrogen or blends. Even for companies not immediately handling hydrogen, this change signals a need to be prepared for future integrity management of alternative fuels.
    
- **Other Technical Updates with Integrity Impacts:** A number of additional technical revisions, while aimed at design and construction, also impact overall pipeline integrity:
    
    - **Girth Weld Strength Matching:** Clauses 4 and 7 were revised to address concerns with **girth weld strength undermatching and heat-affected zone softening** when welding high-strength line pipe in stress-based designs ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=b,based%20design%20pipeline) ). This change ensures weld integrity for modern high-grade steels, thereby supporting long-term integrity (fewer weld-related defects or failures). It affects welding procedures and qualification, indirectly improving pipeline reliability.
    - **Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) Improvements:** **Clause 7.7.4.3 and Table 7.4** were updated to allow using **volumetric NDE (e.g. ultrasonic or radiography)** in lieu of destructive nick-break tests for weld procedure and welder qualifications ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=f%29%20Clause%207,of%20porosity%20in%20nick%20breaks) ). This not only modernizes the testing approach but also can enhance quality control – volumetric inspection can detect internal flaws that nick-break tests might miss, leading to better weld quality and thus better integrity. It also expands allowable porosity limits in nick-breaks, reflecting improved understanding of defect acceptability. These revisions ensure that welding quality (a key aspect of integrity) is achieved with more flexibility and technology.
    - **Cold Bends and Induction Bends:** Requirements for the design of field cold bends were adjusted (for cases of very mild bends with <1.5° deflection per pipe diameter, the design pressure and wall thickness requirements were revised) ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=k,with%20the%20Annex%20B%20revisions) ). Additionally, **new requirements for induction bends and cold bends** were introduced by referencing dedicated manufacturing standards CSA Z245.16 and Z245.17 ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=n,blind%20flanges%20of%20various%20sizes) ). These changes mean that bends in the pipeline (which can be points of stress concentration) will be subject to clearer criteria and quality standards, supporting integrity by reducing the chance of bend-related defects or weaknesses.
    - **Component Specifications:** The new edition imposes additional limitations on certain components – for example, **stricter limits on the use of ASTM A105 flanges** (likely to avoid brittle or low-toughness behavior in certain conditions) ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=n,blind%20flanges%20of%20various%20sizes) ) and expanded requirements for threaded or welded auxiliary connections on blind flanges ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=reports%20for%20pipe%20and%20components) ). Ensuring all components meet higher standards and limitations improves the overall integrity of the system, as substandard fittings or attachments have caused failures historically.

In summary, CSA Z662:23 brings a stronger emphasis on **risk management, data-driven integrity programs, proactive hazard control, and accommodation of new technologies (hydrogen)**. These major revisions collectively push pipeline operators toward a more **systematic and preventative integrity management regime**, beyond what was explicitly required in Z662:19.

## New Compliance Requirements and Implementation Timelines

The adoption of CSA Z662:23 has introduced new compliance obligations for pipeline operators, along with timelines driven by regulatory incorporation of the standard:

- **Immediate Incorporation by Regulators:** The moment CSA Z662:23 was published (30 June 2023), it was **incorporated by reference into federal regulations** for pipelines. The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) officially stated that the latest version **came into force as of its publication date** ([CER – Information Advisory IA 2023-001 – Canadian Standards Association Z662:23 Standard](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/safety-environment/industry-performance/information-safety-advisories/information-advisory/2023/information-advisory-ia-2023-001-canadian-standards-association-z662-23-standard.html#:~:text=Pursuant%20to%20provisions%20of%20Section%C2%A04,to%20the%20public%2C%2030%C2%A0June%202023)). This means that federally regulated pipeline companies had to begin complying with CSA Z662:23 **immediately upon its release in mid-2023**. The CER issued an advisory expecting companies to review the new standard and **“ensure compliance with its provisions as soon as possible.”** ([CER – Information Advisory IA 2023-001 – Canadian Standards Association Z662:23 Standard](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/safety-environment/industry-performance/information-safety-advisories/information-advisory/2023/information-advisory-ia-2023-001-canadian-standards-association-z662-23-standard.html#:~:text=There%20are%20significant%20changes%20and,provisions%20as%20soon%20as%20possible)) For any new project applications under CER jurisdiction around that time, regulators required proponents to demonstrate how they will meet CSA Z662:23 requirements ([CER – Information Advisory IA 2023-001 – Canadian Standards Association Z662:23 Standard](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/safety-environment/industry-performance/information-safety-advisories/information-advisory/2023/information-advisory-ia-2023-001-canadian-standards-association-z662-23-standard.html#:~:text=Safety%20Class%20method%20contained%20within,CSA%C2%A0Z662%3A23)). In practical terms, there was no grace period – the onus was on operators to quickly close any gaps between the 2019 and 2023 requirements.
    
- **Provincial Adoption and Deadlines:** Provincial pipeline regulators likewise moved to adopt the 2023 code, often with immediate effect or specific dates:
    
    - In **British Columbia**, the BC Energy Regulator announced that the new CSA Z662:23 edition is effective immediately (as of October 6, 2023 in their notice) and is incorporated into BC’s Pipeline Regulation ([New Edition of CSA Z662 and New Pipeline Notification Process (TU 2023-15) | BC Energy Regulator (BCER)](https://www.bc-er.ca/news/new-edition-of-csa-z662-and-new-pipeline-notification-process-tu-2023-15/#:~:text=EFFECTIVE%20DATE%3A%20Immediately)). The BCER directed all pipeline permit holders to review Z662:23 and ensure compliance, and notably **requires that on all new pipeline applications, companies confirm whether they are following the new safety class approach of Annex C** ([New Edition of CSA Z662 and New Pipeline Notification Process (TU 2023-15) | BC Energy Regulator (BCER)](https://www.bc-er.ca/news/new-edition-of-csa-z662-and-new-pipeline-notification-process-tu-2023-15/#:~:text=As%20there%20are%20significant%20changes,23)). This implies an immediate compliance checkpoint – if using the risk-based design method, it must be declared and done per the new standard.
    - In **Alberta**, the AER updated its Pipeline Rules to align with CSA Z662:23 by late 2023. The revised Alberta Pipeline Rules came into effect on **November 15, 2023** ([Bulletin 2023-40 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/bulletins/bulletin-2023-40#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20released%20a%20new,and%20gas%20pipelines%20in%20Alberta)) and explicitly align provincial requirements with the new standard’s provisions for **Safety and Loss Management Systems (SLMS) and Integrity Management Programs** (reflecting Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of Z662:23) ([Bulletin 2023-40 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/bulletins/bulletin-2023-40#:~:text=Operations%20open,section%2031)). Alberta’s directive changes also reference updating practices to be consistent with Z662:23 for design, operation, and maintenance. One noteworthy change in Alberta’s rules allows pipeline licensees **up to 24 months (instead of 12) to resume, discontinue, or abandon a pipeline that is being managed under an integrity management program** ([Bulletin 2023-40 | Alberta Energy Regulator](https://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/bulletins/bulletin-2023-40#:~:text=integrity%29%20%28section%2067%29%3B%20,an%20integrity%20management%20program%3B%20and)) – this change recognizes the role of active IMP monitoring, and provides operators a bit more flexibility under provincial law when an IMP is in place.
    - **Ontario** adopted CSA Z662-23 through an amendment to its Oil and Gas Pipeline Code Adoption Document effective August 6, 2024 ([](https://www.tssa.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/Oil%20%26%20Gas%20Pipeline%20Systems%20CAD-FS-253-24-Fuels-CAD.pdf#:~:text=Date%3A%20August%206%2C%202024%20Background%3A,23%2C%20is%20adopted)). From that date, all pipelines under Ontario jurisdiction must comply with Z662:23 (with some specific provincial amendments, such as definitions for high consequence areas). The staggered Ontario timeline gave operators roughly a year beyond publication to transition, reflecting the date when the province formally updated its legal adoption of the code.
- **New Compliance Obligations in the Standard:** Aside from regulator-imposed timelines, CSA Z662:23 itself contains _new explicit requirements_ that operators must comply with in their pipeline management:
    
    - **Integrity Management Program (IMP) Requirement:** While integrity management programs were recommended in previous editions, Z662:23 makes it very clear that pipeline operators **shall have an integrity management program covering the pipeline’s life cycle** (Clause 3.2, with details in Annex N) ([Pipeline Compliance Standards Summary Checklist](https://www.tssa.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/Pipeline%20Compliance%20Standard%20Summary%20Checklist-Pipeline%20Owners%20%26%20Operators-Fuels-Checklist.pdf#:~:text=Integrity%20Management%20Program%20CSA%20Z662,monitoring%20%E2%80%A2%20Maintenance%20and%20repair)). This codifies the requirement that every pipeline operator must implement an IMP that includes processes for data collection, threat identification, risk assessment, mitigation, and continuous improvement. Companies that did not have a formal IMP under Z662:19 now **must develop one to be compliant**. Those with existing IMPs need to update them to meet the expanded scope (e.g. integrating the quantitative risk criteria from Annex B).
    - **Safety and Loss Management Systems:** Similarly, CSA Z662:23 requires operators to have a documented **Safety and Loss Management System (SLMS)** (Clause 3.1) to ensure protection of people, environment, and property ([Pipeline Compliance Standards Summary Checklist](https://www.tssa.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/Pipeline%20Compliance%20Standard%20Summary%20Checklist-Pipeline%20Owners%20%26%20Operators-Fuels-Checklist.pdf#:~:text=Safety%20and%20Loss%20Management%20Program,life%20cycle%20of%20the%20pipeline)). The SLMS is an over-arching management system in which the IMP is a key component. This was conceptually present in Z662:19 but is now more formalized. Regulators (like AER and CER) are placing greater emphasis on companies having robust SLMS/IMP frameworks and will audit against them for compliance.
    - **Hydrogen-Specific Requirements:** For operators venturing into hydrogen service, compliance with the **new Clause 17 is mandatory**. This includes using appropriate materials, performing additional testing, and possibly derating pipelines for hydrogen service as required by the standard. Any pipeline transporting hydrogen blends must meet these new design and operating requirements – a compliance area that simply did not exist in CSA Z662:19. Companies planning projects involving hydrogen (or converting existing gas pipelines to hydrogen blend service) need to incorporate these Clause 17 provisions from the start, as regulators will expect full compliance with the hydrogen-related standards.
    - **Recordkeeping and Audit Readiness:** The new record retention rules (for material test reports and other records in Clauses 5 and 12) are now enforceable requirements ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=h%29%20Clause%2012,all%20steel%20pipe%20and%20components) ) ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=m,reports%20for%20pipe%20and%20components) ). Operators must ensure that they collect and retain all required documentation going forward. This may necessitate back-checking recent projects to gather any missing MTRs so that the pipeline’s file is complete. Additionally, the **common framework for audits** introduced via Clause 3 and Annex A means that companies should prepare for more uniform audits of their management systems ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=a,a%20common%20framework%20for%20audits) ). Compliance here means not only having the programs in place but also being able to demonstrate their effectiveness and adherence to CSA Z662:23 when audited by regulators or third parties.

In summary, **CSA Z662:23 is now in force across Canada**, with federal and provincial regulators requiring compliance essentially upon adoption of the code (mid to late 2023 for most jurisdictions). Pipeline operators are expected to **promptly update their practices, programs, and documentation** to meet new requirements – from having integrity programs that reflect the latest risk criteria to ensuring design projects incorporate the 2023 changes. Where new features like the safety class approach are used, regulators require clear indication and adherence to the new methods ([New Edition of CSA Z662 and New Pipeline Notification Process (TU 2023-15) | BC Energy Regulator (BCER)](https://www.bc-er.ca/news/new-edition-of-csa-z662-and-new-pipeline-notification-process-tu-2023-15/#:~:text=As%20there%20are%20significant%20changes,23)). Companies should treat the CSA Z662:23 changes not as optional guidance but as binding requirements and adjust their compliance plans accordingly.

## Changes Increasing Engineering Design Workload

The 2019-to-2023 revisions of CSA Z662 have introduced new design considerations and analytical steps that will likely **increase the engineering workload** for pipeline design and integrity teams. Key areas where the new standard can add complexity or effort include:

- **Risk-Based Design Analysis:** The introduction of the **Safety Class designation approach** (Annex C) means that if an operator opts to design a pipeline using this method, engineers must perform a detailed risk assessment for each pipeline segment to assign a safety class ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=ii,the%20maximum%20allowable%20hoop%20stress) ). This goes beyond the traditional practice of simply determining population class locations. Engineers will need to analyze site-specific factors like potential leak consequences, probabilities of failure, and environmental sensitivities to justify the assigned safety class. Essentially, design now can require a _quantitative risk model_ underpinning the wall thickness, grade, and pressure selections. Developing and validating these risk assessments (and then mapping them to location classes for other code provisions) is an added step that increases upfront engineering effort.
    
- **Hydrogen Pipeline Design and Materials Selection:** With the new Clause 17 covering hydrogen pipelines, any transmission pipeline intended for hydrogen service (or conversion to hydrogen blending) demands additional engineering work. Designers must account for **hydrogen embrittlement effects on materials, tighter leak tolerance, and specialized welding and fittings** suitable for hydrogen ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=ii,requirements%20into%20this%20Standard%3B%20and) ). They may need to consult additional research or standards (e.g. ASME, ISO for hydrogen) to supplement CSA Z662’s requirements. If a pipeline is being designed to carry natural gas today but with future hydrogen capability, the design team now has to dual-validate it for both cases. This **added scope of material testing, modeling of hydrogen diffusion, and conservative design factors** (often lower for hydrogen) will increase the workload. In short, designing pipelines under Z662:23 for new gases is more complex and multidisciplinary, involving metallurgy and chemistry considerations that were not part of a typical CSA Z662:19 design process.
    
- **Welding Procedure Qualification and Materials Engineering:** The changes addressing **girth weld strength matching** for high-grade steels (Clauses 4/7) ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=b,based%20design%20pipeline) ) mean engineers and welding specialists must carefully evaluate welding procedures when using X70, X80 or higher-strength pipe. They might need to specify higher-strength weld consumables or alternative welding techniques to avoid under-matched welds. This could involve additional welding procedure development and testing. Furthermore, the allowance of **volumetric NDE in lieu of nick-break tests** ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=f%29%20Clause%207,of%20porosity%20in%20nick%20breaks) ), while providing flexibility, may require companies to invest in advanced ultrasonic or radiographic methods during procedure qualification. Engineering teams will have to update welding specifications, qualify new procedures using these NDE techniques, and possibly train NDE technicians – all of which add to the pre-construction workload.
    
- **Component and Detail Design Checks:** The 2023 edition’s refinements on components impose extra checks during design:
    
    - **Flange Selection:** Engineers must verify that selected flanges (e.g., ASTM A105) are within the newly imposed limitations ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=n,blind%20flanges%20of%20various%20sizes) ). If a design would push A105 flanges beyond safe limits (for example, in low-temperature or high-pressure service), engineers now need to specify alternative materials (like ASTM A350 LF2 or higher-grade flanges). This entails reviewing all flange applications in the design and possibly re-selecting and re-calculating them, which is additional work.
    - **Induction and Cold Bends:** The reference to new CSA standards for bends (Z245.16 for induction bends, Z245.17 for cold bends) means design engineers must ensure any custom bends or bending procedures comply with these standards ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=n,blind%20flanges%20of%20various%20sizes) ). In practice, this requires coordinating with bend suppliers, understanding the new specifications, and possibly performing additional bend testing or qualification. The design documentation has to capture these compliance steps, increasing the level of detail engineers must manage.
    - **Coating and Materials Management:** The new requirement to **requalify coated pipe that has been in extended storage** ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=p,17) ) can affect project schedules and design assumptions. If a project intends to use stockpiled pipe, engineers must account for time and processes to inspect and re-verify that pipe’s integrity (coating condition, no excessive corrosion, mechanical properties intact) before use. Planning for these inspections and potential pipe material substitutions adds to the design phase workload.
- **Integrating Integrity Considerations into Design:** With Z662:23’s emphasis on lifecycle integrity, design engineers will find themselves collaborating more with integrity management personnel early in the project. For example, the requirement for **continuous right-of-way hazard management** ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=g,hazards%20to%20the%20pipeline%20system) ) might influence route selection and design decisions (to avoid known geohazard areas or provide additional protection in high-risk zones). **Cross-bore mitigation** requirements mean that if a pipeline is to be installed via drilling, the design must include surveys of existing utilities and possibly a plan for post-installation inspections (such as video scoping of nearby lines) ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=test%20reports%20for%20all%20steel,pipe%20and%20components) ). These are tasks traditionally considered during construction or operation, but now they loop back into the design phase. This interdisciplinary planning – ensuring the design will allow effective integrity management – increases the workload on the design team to foresee and accommodate these factors (e.g., adding casing, strike avoidance measures, or monitoring equipment in the design).
    

Overall, CSA Z662:23 pushes for a design process that is **more thorough and forward-looking regarding integrity**. Engineers will spend additional time on analyses (risk, materials, hazards) and on documentation (records, compliance justification). While these steps increase the upfront workload, they are aimed at reducing failures and rework down the line by “building in” integrity from the start. Pipeline companies may need to allocate more engineering hours and possibly invest in new software/tools to meet these design-phase requirements of the 2023 standard.

## New Skill Sets and Expertise Needed for Compliance

To effectively comply with CSA Z662:23’s new integrity management provisions, organizations may need to **develop or acquire additional expertise**. The updates demand a broader skill set spanning risk analysis, new materials, and advanced management systems. Key areas where new or enhanced expertise may be required include:

- **Hydrogen Pipeline Expertise:** With the incorporation of hydrogen pipelines into CSA Z662:23, engineers and integrity specialists will need knowledge in **hydrogen embrittlement, hydrogen-compatible materials, and gas blending effects**. This includes understanding how high-pressure hydrogen affects steel microstructure, what pipeline coatings and seals are required to contain hydrogen, and how to safely convert or design pipelines for hydrogen service ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=c,pipeline%20systems%2C%20has%20been%20added) ) ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=ii,requirements%20into%20this%20Standard%3B%20and) ). Many pipeline teams historically focused on natural gas or oil service will have to **build expertise in hydrogen technologies** – potentially by training or hiring materials scientists and engineers experienced in hydrogen transport.
    
- **Risk Management and Quantitative Analysis:** The heightened focus on risk assessments (Annex B) means companies will need professionals skilled in **pipeline risk modeling and data analysis**. This could involve statistical risk modelers or engineers who can calculate probability of failure, consequence impacts, and use tools to quantify risk levels for pipeline segments. The introduction of **quantitative risk acceptance criteria** for safety and environmental risks ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=mitigation) ) effectively requires that someone in the organization can perform or interpret complex risk calculations (e.g., calculating individual risk per kilometer per year, or potential loss of containment scenarios). Developing an in-house capability for quantitative risk assessment – or using consultants with this expertise – will be important for compliance and for making use of the new safety class design option. Additionally, understanding **risk-based decision making** will be crucial for integrity management program personnel to prioritize mitigations in line with the Annex B guidance.
    
- **Integrity Data Integration and Analysis:** As integrity management programs must cover the pipeline **life cycle and integrate various data sources** ([Pipeline Compliance Standards Summary Checklist](https://www.tssa.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/Pipeline%20Compliance%20Standard%20Summary%20Checklist-Pipeline%20Owners%20%26%20Operators-Fuels-Checklist.pdf#:~:text=An%20Integrity%20Management%20Program%20that,Operating%20conditions%20%E2%80%A2%20Failure%20incidents)), companies will need stronger skills in data management and analysis. This includes expertise in using pipeline integrity software systems, GIS mapping for pipeline assets, and possibly machine learning to detect integrity threats from big data (e.g., large ILI datasets or sensor data). Personnel will need to know how to collect and analyze information on corrosion, mechanical damage, pressure cycling, etc., and how to interpret this data to make maintenance decisions. The new audit framework (Clause 3/Annex A) also implies that data needs to be well organized and auditable. Thus, **data science and database management skills** are increasingly relevant in pipeline integrity teams to ensure all required records (like material test reports, inspection findings, mitigation actions) are not only kept but readily retrievable and analyzable for compliance demonstration.
    
- **Regulatory Compliance and Auditing Skills:** With more explicit requirements around management systems (SLMS, IMP) and audits, companies may need to invest in training **internal auditors or compliance managers** who understand CSA Z662:23 in depth. These individuals should be capable of conducting internal audits of the integrity management program against Annex N and Annex B criteria, identifying gaps, and ensuring readiness for external audits by regulators. Skills in **document control, process auditing, and continuous improvement** methodologies (like Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles) will help meet the common audit framework now envisioned by Clause 3 and Annex A ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=a,a%20common%20framework%20for%20audits) ). Essentially, pipeline operators will benefit from having staff with a **management systems background** (often borrowed from quality or safety management professions) to oversee the holistic implementation of the standard’s programmatic requirements.
    
- **Materials and NDE Technology Proficiency:** The changes in material and testing requirements call for enhanced expertise in those domains:
    
    - Materials engineers need to be well-versed in the new specifications for bends (CSA Z245.16/.17) and in judging material test reports for compliance. They should understand the limits of certain materials like ASTM A105 flanges and know when higher-grade materials are required ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=n,blind%20flanges%20of%20various%20sizes) ). The mandate to retain MTRs means materials engineers (or procurement specialists) must also ensure that proper documentation is received from manufacturers and that it meets CSA requirements – a detail-oriented task.
    - NDE (Non-destructive examination) specialists will need to be knowledgeable in advanced techniques such as automated ultrasonic testing (AUT) or phased-array UT, since **volumetric examination is now explicitly allowed to replace mechanical tests for weld qualifications** ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=f%29%20Clause%207,of%20porosity%20in%20nick%20breaks) ). Having NDE technicians or welding engineers who can develop **appropriate ultrasonic inspection procedures** and interpret results is important to take advantage of this change. Furthermore, as integrity programs rely on in-line inspection (ILI) tools and other NDE for in-service assessment, expertise in the latest inspection technologies (crack detection tools, mapping of dents, etc.) remains a critical skill set. The standard’s evolution continues to support modern inspection methods, so keeping technical staff up-to-date on NDE capabilities is part of compliance.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Hazard Management:** The requirement for continuous right-of-way hazard monitoring and cross-bore prevention means pipeline operators should bolster skills in **geotechnical engineering and utility locating**. Geotechnical experts can help assess and mitigate slope instabilities or ground movement threats to pipelines (aligning with Clause 10’s hazard management focus). Utility coordination specialists or subsurface utility engineers can improve cross-bore mitigation by ensuring thorough scans and clearance in congested corridors. These skill sets help address integrity threats that are outside the traditional pipeline engineering curriculum, reflecting a more interdisciplinary approach to pipeline safety.
    

In essence, CSA Z662:23 raises the bar not just for **what** must be done to manage pipeline integrity, but for the **breadth of knowledge** required to do it effectively. Pipeline companies may need to train existing staff in these new areas or hire specialists (for example, hydrogen materials consultants or risk analysts) to meet the demands of the updated standard. Those organizations that proactively develop these competencies will find it easier to comply with the new code and to enhance the safety and reliability of their pipeline systems.

## Conclusion

The transition from CSA Z662-2019 to CSA Z662-2023 represents a significant advancement in pipeline integrity management practices. The new edition brings a more **proactive and systematic approach** – embedding risk assessment into design, expanding integrity program expectations, and addressing emerging areas like hydrogen transportation. Major changes such as quantitative risk criteria, safety class design, and explicit hazard mitigation requirements will improve pipeline safety but also require operators to update their processes. Compliance with the 2023 standard has been mandated swiftly by regulators, meaning pipeline operators must adapt without delay. This adaptation comes with increased engineering workload in design and analysis, and it demands new expertise in fields that support pipeline integrity (risk analysis, hydrogen effects, data management, etc.).

Overall, CSA Z662:23’s changes, especially those focused on integrity management for transmission pipelines, are **geared toward preventing incidents and losses** through better planning and monitoring. By understanding and implementing these updates – from ensuring every weld and bend meets the latest criteria to integrating comprehensive risk-based strategies – pipeline operators will not only meet compliance obligations but also achieve a higher level of control over their assets’ integrity throughout their service life ([CER – Information Advisory IA 2023-001 – Canadian Standards Association Z662:23 Standard](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/safety-environment/industry-performance/information-safety-advisories/information-advisory/2023/information-advisory-ia-2023-001-canadian-standards-association-z662-23-standard.html#:~:text=There%20are%20significant%20changes%20and,provisions%20as%20soon%20as%20possible)) ([CSA Z662:23 | Product | CSA Group](https://www.csagroup.org/store/product/CSA%20Z662:23/?srsltid=AfmBOorYsk8SFim_S9hcgXUN1FuUxZDNYGYI-FavRj3V5k7xz897E3RL#:~:text=mitigation) ). The 2019-to-2023 revisions therefore mark an important step in the continuous improvement of pipeline safety standards, challenging the industry to rise to a new standard of excellence in integrity management.
