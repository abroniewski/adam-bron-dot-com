# Incident Command System - Management Tools

💡 Concepts from Incident Command System (ICS) that I use in [**#IncidentResponse**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=incidentresponse&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6711469533305155585) can be applied to non-emergency work too!  
  
ICS was shaped in the 70s by veterans of WWII who applied their command and control experience to wildfire management.  
  
It's like creating an instant startup company to get things done quickly, and every time it's created it follows a predictable path; a standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of a response.  
  
Some key concepts:  
1. Unity of Command - everyone has 1 superior (accountability)  
2. Span of Control - 3-7 people accountable to you (prevents overload)  
3. Modular - the organization can grow or contract as needed (flexible)  
4. Common terminology - all the positions, words and functions are common (easy cohesion and communication)  
5. Incident Action Plans - everyone works to accomplish specific time-bound objectives (tactics based on strategy)  
6. Communication - strict communication protocols are used to make sure the right people are in the know  
7. Coordination - ICS allows multiple organizations to easily work together and pool resources (unified command)  
  
I love the Incident Action Plan; working today to create a objective-driven plan for tomorrow that can be handed off and executed by operations...
