## Summary

- Enterprise AI is entering an industrial phase: investment is scaling, but policy scrutiny is scaling with it.
- Regulatory and governance expectations are hardening across regions, especially where platforms and AI-generated content intersect.
- B2B buying behavior is being reshaped by GenAI-assisted research and higher proof expectations from buying committees.
- For Konekti, the opportunity is to link AI ambition to measurable execution outcomes under stricter governance conditions.

## Coherent storyline: what matters now

Today’s signal is a three-way convergence between capital, policy, and buying behavior.

First, investment momentum remains strong. Reuters reports large technology commitments tied to India’s AI summit, showing continued capacity build-out and ecosystem acceleration in strategic growth markets ([Tech majors commit billions of dollars to India at AI summit](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/tech-majors-commit-billions-dollars-india-ai-summit-2026-02-19/), Reuters).

Second, governance pressure is becoming more explicit. Reuters coverage highlights tougher platform content expectations in India, while EU channels are publishing implementation-oriented guidance and coalition mechanisms around responsible AI deployment ([India tells global tech platforms to follow constitution after tougher content rules](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/india-tells-global-tech-platforms-follow-constitution-after-tougher-content-2026-02-17/), Reuters) ([Guidelines for implementing the AI Act](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/free-and-open-source-software/news/guidelines-implementing-ai-act), Interoperable Europe) ([The Apply AI Alliance: A new forum shaping Europe’s future with responsible AI](https://data.europa.eu/en/news-events/news/apply-ai-alliance-new-forum-shaping-europes-future-responsible-artificial), data.europa.eu).

Third, buyer behavior is shifting from interest to proof. Forrester’s 2026 buying signals point to GenAI changing how buyers discover, evaluate, and shortlist vendors, with stronger pressure on evidence, trust, and execution clarity ([Forrester’s 2026 Buyer Insights: GenAI Is Upending B2B Buying](https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-2026-the-state-of-business-buying/), Forrester) ([2026 Buyer Insights](https://www.forrester.com/research/buyer-insights/), Forrester).

McKinsey’s framing of AI’s “industrial phase” in technology M&A supports the same pattern: consolidation and platform choices are likely to reward vendors that combine operational impact with enterprise readiness ([Technology M&A: AI enters its industrial phase](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/m-and-a/our-insights/technology-m-and-a-ai-enters-its-industrial-phase), McKinsey).

## Why this matters for stakeholders

### CIO
The requirement is no longer AI experimentation alone. CIOs must show they can scale AI safely across jurisdictions and policy environments while maintaining delivery reliability.

### CFO
As AI spend expands, scrutiny on return quality rises. CFO stakeholders will prioritize measurable operational outcomes, not just adoption headlines.

### COO
Operations leaders need AI programs that improve execution consistency under policy constraints, especially in cross-functional workflows where delays and exceptions drive cost.

### Data and platform teams
Teams must design for compliance-readiness by default: auditability, model governance, and policy-aligned deployment practices are becoming baseline enterprise expectations.

### Revenue leaders (CRO/VP Sales)
Go-to-market motion must adapt to AI-assisted buyers: clearer proof points, shorter time-to-value narratives, and stronger objection handling around trust and governance.

### Strategy and partnerships
M&A and ecosystem shifts suggest buyers may prefer integrated operating stacks. Partnership and positioning decisions should reflect that bundling pressure.

## Konekti implications this week

1. Tighten market narrative to: **“AI execution that is measurable, governable, and fast to operationalize.”**
2. Add governance-forward proof to client materials (policy alignment, risk controls, traceability) alongside outcome metrics.
3. Rework buyer-facing content for GenAI-era evaluation behavior: clearer evidence hierarchy, role-specific ROI, and trust signals.
4. Track consolidation signals and partnership opportunities where Konekti can anchor in execution intelligence rather than generic AI messaging.
