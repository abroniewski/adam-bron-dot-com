Hi Adam,

Here is your first daily morning digest draft in website-ready format.

## 1) Newsletter Radar

### Process mining is moving from reporting to real-time process intelligence
- The strongest narrative this week is the shift from retrospective diagnostics toward ongoing monitoring and intervention.
- Framing to reuse: "from visibility to control".
- Why this matters for your weekly newsletter: this is a strategic evolution story, not just a tooling update.

### OCPM is maturing from concept to practical adoption in CoEs
- Object-centric process mining is appearing more in practical deployment discussions, not only in theory.
- Suggested editorial angle: where object-centric modelling drives value versus where simple case-centric modelling is still the better choice.

### Control towers are being reframed as action systems
- A recurring pattern is the distinction between dashboards and operating control loops.
- Strong explainer opportunity: "What is happening now, and what should we do next?"

## 2) Platform Learning and Market Updates

### Snowflake
- Release stream continues to blend AI and governance: Cortex-related updates, Notebooks maturity, security and data policy improvements.
- Client-facing implication: enterprise teams will ask for AI productivity and strong controls in the same programme.

### Databricks
- Runtime and platform release cadence remains high (LTS plus frequent feature updates).
- Client-facing implication: teams need a stronger operating model for versioning, validation, and use-case rollout.

### Celonis
- Recent updates point to three themes: usability/accessibility, stronger integration governance, and deeper object-centric analysis support.
- Client-facing implication: process intelligence is becoming more operable across business and technical teams.

### SAP Signavio, UiPath, QPR
- Source extraction quality was mixed in this first pass.
- Plan: improve source adapters and include more complete update coverage in tomorrow’s digest.

## 3) Learning Corner

### What is a control tower?
A control tower is a real-time operational layer that combines cross-system data, surfaces deviations, and supports intervention decisions. It should help teams act, not only observe.

### What is an accelerator?
An accelerator is a reusable package of assets (for example data model patterns, KPI logic, integration components, and playbooks) that shortens time-to-value and reduces implementation risk.

### What does "building a new process mining use case" actually involve?
At minimum:
1. Define the decision to improve and the accountable owner.
2. Define process/object scope.
3. Connect and validate data.
4. Set baseline KPIs.
5. Detect and prioritise deviations.
6. Tie insights to interventions and value tracking.

## 4) Executive Lens (Stakeholder Pressures)

### CIO
- Pressure: deliver AI-enabled transformation without increasing cyber and architecture fragility.
- Message that resonates: governed scale and resilience.

### CFO
- Pressure: prove returns on AI and transformation investments under uncertainty.
- Message that resonates: measurable value, capital discipline, and risk-aware prioritisation.

### COO
- Pressure: improve service levels, cycle time, and resilience during disruption.
- Message that resonates: faster exception handling and dependable operational outcomes.

### COE Leaders
- Pressure: move from pilot-heavy work to repeatable value delivery.
- Message that resonates: standardised use-case playbooks and transparent value tracking.
