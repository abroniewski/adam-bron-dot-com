## Forwardable summary

- **Execution platforms are converging on the same posture: ship AI capability with stronger controls, not AI capability alone**. Snowflake’s February stream combines Cortex features with governance/security updates, while Celonis is pairing automation advances with stronger OAuth and admin controls.

- **Control tower language is shifting from dashboarding to decision velocity**. Both Celonis and IBM frame control towers as operational systems for exception response, not passive reporting.

- **For Konekti, the highest-leverage narrative is “from visibility to intervention”**: connect process intelligence to governed action loops and measurable value outcomes.

- **Today’s 24h market scan produced limited truly new high-signal items** from core platforms, so this digest prioritises synthesis of what changed most recently and what that implies strategically now.

## Coherent storyline: what matters now

The signal is not that one vendor released one feature. The signal is that enterprise data and process platforms are increasingly packaging **capability + control** together in the same release cycles. In practical terms, this means enterprise buyers are becoming less tolerant of “innovation first, governance later” roadmaps. [Snowflake Release Notes: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/new-features] [Celonis Release Notes: https://docs.celonis.com/en/release-notes.html]

In parallel, operating-model language is maturing. Control towers are now framed around rapid detection and action, which aligns with process intelligence adoption moving from periodic analysis to always-on intervention logic. That is exactly where Konekti can lead with a differentiated point of view: decision velocity + implementation realism.

## Why this matters for stakeholders

- **CIO pressure**: scale AI and automation without creating architecture and security debt. That increases demand for governed execution approaches.

- **CFO pressure**: prove transformation return with credible control and risk management, not experimentation theatre. [PwC CFO priorities: https://www.pwc.com/us/en/executive-leadership-hub/cfo.html]
- **COO/COE pressure**: improve exception handling speed while preserving service levels and operational stability.

## Konekti implications this week

1. **Positioning**: use “from visibility to intervention” as the primary narrative spine in client conversations and content.
2. **Delivery framing**: make governance part of value delivery language, not a separate workstream.
3. **Market monitoring**: continue freshness-first scanning and expand the watchlist through trusted-source graph expansion (partners, competitors, and referenced thought leaders).

## Coverage note (freshness policy)

This digest was generated with a freshness-first scan on 2026-02-15. Where high-signal, timestamped updates were sparse in the last 24 hours, claims were limited to what could be validated from currently published source pages and explicitly cited.
