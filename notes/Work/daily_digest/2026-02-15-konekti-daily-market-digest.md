## Summary

- Enterprise platforms are moving in the same direction: new AI features are being shipped together with stronger governance and security controls.
- The market conversation is shifting from "visibility" to "intervention", meaning teams are expected to not just detect issues but act faster when issues appear.
- This creates a clear Konekti opportunity: position around faster decision-making, measurable outcomes, and practical implementation.
- Buyer pressure is converging across IT, finance, operations, and delivery teams, so value stories need to be role-specific but operationally consistent.

## Coherent storyline: what matters now

The key signal is not one isolated feature release. The key signal is convergence.

Snowflake’s recent updates combine AI capabilities with control features in the same release stream, including security and policy-related improvements ([Snowflake server release notes and feature updates](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/new-features), published updates listed for Feb 13, 2026 and earlier).

Celonis shows a similar pattern, pairing workflow and automation improvements with governance upgrades like OAuth 2.0 for Action Flows ([Celonis release notes](https://docs.celonis.com/en/release-notes.html), bi-weekly "What’s New" page, current publication as of Feb 2026).

This matters because enterprise buyers are becoming less tolerant of "innovation now, controls later". They want both at once. In simple terms: if a tool helps teams move faster but creates new risk, adoption slows.

At the same time, control tower language is changing. Older dashboard thinking focused on reporting what happened. New control tower framing focuses on two practical questions: "What is happening right now?" and "What should we do next?" ([Celonis control tower explainer](https://www.celonis.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-getting-ahead-of-disruption-and-building-resilience), published Jan 2025) ([IBM control tower explainer](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/control-towers), updated Dec 2025).

This aligns with broader process mining direction, where the market is moving from periodic analysis to continuous process intelligence and faster intervention loops ([Process Excellence Network trends](https://www.processexcellencenetwork.com/process-mining/articles/6-trends-shaping-process-mining-in-2026), published Dec 3, 2025).

## Why this matters for stakeholders

### CIO
The pressure is to scale AI and automation without creating fragile systems or new security risk. For CIOs, "good" now means both speed and control, not one or the other ([CIO priorities for 2026](https://www.cio.com/article/4117023/10-top-priorities-for-cios-in-2026.html), published Jan 2026).

### CFO
The pressure is to prove business return from AI and transformation spending. That means clear value tracking, disciplined investment choices, and lower execution risk ([PwC CFO priorities](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/executive-leadership-hub/cfo.html), 2026 priorities page).

### COO
The pressure is operational stability under disruption. That includes faster handling of exceptions, fewer delays, and better service reliability when conditions change ([Celonis control tower explainer](https://www.celonis.com/blog/supply-chain-control-towers-getting-ahead-of-disruption-and-building-resilience), Jan 2025) ([IBM control tower explainer](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/control-towers), Dec 2025).

### Data engineers
The pressure is delivery reliability. They need clean pipelines, stable integrations, and secure data foundations so downstream analytics and AI do not break in production. Frequent release cycles increase the need for better release discipline ([Databricks release notes hub](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/release-notes), monthly release stream).

### Process owners
The pressure is practical improvement in day-to-day operations. They are accountable for cycle time, quality, and handoff performance. They need tools that show where process friction happens and what action to take next.

### COE leads
The pressure is to move from isolated pilots to repeatable value delivery. In plain terms: fewer one-off projects, more reusable methods that can scale across teams and regions.

## Konekti implications this week

1. Use "from visibility to intervention" as the core message in client conversations.
2. Make governance part of the value proposition from day one, not a later phase.
3. Build role-specific narratives for CIO, CFO, COO, data engineers, process owners, and COE leads so each audience sees direct relevance.
4. Continue tracking competitor and partner signals with freshness-first scanning and source expansion.
