optimizing production
IP curve when first opening well -> IP number is something reported to shareholders
how much sand, pressures, opening choke
competitors using excel sheets and not doing much with it
have data lake, but dont do much with it.

Questions -> what can i learn from this data? seems to be missing the right measure to help make a real correlation

Get pitches from people that have some data mining software -> no one really doing a good job with it.

Example: Pump jack optimization for a field, turned over to AI and had success

Oxy.com -> network of wells trying to get into pipeline, otpimzing boost compresses on each pad. Balancing pressure to get the most efficiency (burn less gas and still)

R2 solutions -> Clint is the person they work with. [Analytics - www.r2-solutions.com](https://www.r2-solutions.com/analytics)

NetSuite (Oracle) is what they use.
R2 takes data from the backend and starts to combine and work with it.

SAP/ERPs -> will need this. And MUST tie it back to financial impact.

Have 200 wells that are flowing back. Monitoring velocity and amount of sand. Found insights into the speed of sand flow

Problem to move to 

Optimizing the IP curve (peak vs breadth)
- issue is that they don't know the completions/well construction. Proprietary data
market data -> multiphase metering. Cna buy data ($10k) for data + presentation

Having someone that understands the problem and physical aspects whould be a huge value add.

Roo.ai

Needs + Helps
- Sanity checks on other projects

Intros
- Tim Klassen - R2 solutions -> provide me with some perspective on where to position, how to position myself.

## 🧠 Meeting Summary: Exploration with Brent Coombe (EnerCorp CTO)

**Date:** 16 May 2025
**Attendees:** Adam Broniewski, Brent Coombe  
**Purpose:** Introductory conversation to explore potential applications of data science in oil & gas, understand Brent’s context, and identify future collaboration opportunities.
Here’s a detailed, client-ready summary of your meeting with Brent Coombe:

---
### 🔹 Brent’s Background & Current Role

* **CTO at EnerCorp**, Brent evolved into his position organically after proving his technical aptitude in building internal tools and “tech widgets.”
* He **did not originally come from a software or data background**, but through grassroots innovation became the de facto technology lead.
* His technical leadership emerged from deep operational knowledge rather than formal tech training.
* Brent emphasized a **systems-level view**, connecting operational realities with tech development.

---

### 🔹 EnerCorp’s Data and Operations Landscape

* Data is **central but underutilized**; Brent is actively working on building the **infrastructure to support better decision-making**.
* A core issue: they often lack **specific or granular data** needed to model operations effectively.
* EnerCorp is exploring **data augmentation**, potentially through **external or purchased datasets**, to improve correlations and forecasting.
* **SAP is deeply embedded** in operations—any proposed tool must **integrate with SAP** or work in parallel.
* They're currently trying to improve **data quality at the source**, e.g., better digital forms and process controls to prevent garbage-in/garbage-out problems.
* **Privacy and IP sensitivity** are major concerns when working with customer data—trust and encryption mechanisms (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs) could play a role in future solutions.

### 🔹 Adam’s Business Development Takeaways

**Key Opportunity Areas:**

1. **Lightweight SAP-integrated tooling** that enhances user experience without disrupting existing infrastructure.
2. **Internal analytics tools** focused on pre-failure root cause identification (data collection before something breaks).
3. **Secure, anonymized modeling pipelines** that let clients retain ownership of data while allowing for collaboration.
4. **Custom data models for pipeline or well performance**, especially if aligned with operational anomalies and risk mitigation.
5. **Dashboards or interfaces** tailored to EnerCorp’s existing Microsoft tech stack (e.g., Power BI integration).
6. **Storytelling and decision-support tools** using process data (could leverage Adam's experience with object-centric data models).

**Strategic Insights:**

* There’s resistance to “new platforms”—**integration and enhancement > replacement.**
* **Mid-sized firms or specialized teams** (rather than large enterprise-wide engagements) may be the best entry point.
* Brent expressed **strong interest in ongoing brainstorming**. Open to bouncing ideas and sanity checks.

---

### 🔹 Personal Notes & Context

* Brent spent time at TC Energy and considered international relocation for personal reasons, eventually shifting into CTO work through hands-on tech development.
* He appreciates **practical, domain-aligned solutions**, and **strongly distrusts overconfident vendors**.
* His communication style is candid, honest, and experience-driven. Prefers WhatsApp for contact over email or LinkedIn.

---

### ✅ Next Steps

* **Send follow-up note** including the WIC alumni event invite (Brent may attend).
* **Reach out casually via WhatsApp** with interesting use cases or brainstorms—he’s receptive to informal exchanges.
* **Explore a lightweight demo** or concept around:

  * Trust-enhanced data sharing models
  * SAP-adjacent tools that reduce cognitive load for operators
* Consider a **short list of Calgary-based prospects** who could benefit from similar solutions and ask Brent for additional warm intros (e.g., Tim at Oxy).
