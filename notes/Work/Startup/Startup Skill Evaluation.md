# Startup Steps
1. Define vision
2. Explore a potential market space that we can enter
3. Within this market place, how are others making money? How can we make money?
	1. **Mission and Purpose**: Understand client needs and develop MobilityDB to help clients increase effectiveness. Support people in transitioning to or using MobilityDB to get the most out of it quickly without a bottom line cost.
	2. The purpose of money is to support a team of people that can achieve the M&P.
4. Build-Measure-Learn cycles
	1. With an idea in place, develop KPIs to see if it's profitable. Launch, measure and iterate. Repeat
		1. KPIs need to support learning. There should be some aspect I am measuring specifically to see if it should be evolved, dropped, or changed.
		2. Identify the leap of faith assumptions that we have as part of the idea. Those assumptions can lead to succeess or failure, and form the basis of different tests and iterations.
	2. MVP - Does not need to be working product, but something that supports validaation of a business hypothesis.
	3. Measure MVP against pre-defined KPIs
		1. These are done in fast **batches**. Avoid big complexe moves that introduce lots of variables or reduce cycle time.
	4. Results of measurements drive the next iteration
	5. If necessary, **pivot**. Pivot is a brand new hypothesis that needs to go through cycle again.
	6. **Grow** based on past customer behaviour. Identify growth engine (sticky, viral, paid), develpp metrcis to help track this, and run it.
	7. Build a cutlure, systems and a team that continues to question previosuly proven assumptions and that re-evaluates tehcnology and busienss to continue answering client needs. **Adapt**
	8. Include **innovation** as part of regular business. Support and cultivate innovation and entrepreneurship in team.
