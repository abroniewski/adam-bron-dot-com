# Resonating Message

We must rethink the way we look at business, creating a culture and environment that insists assumpted be stated and tested rapidly, to efficiently identify and validate value and growth hypothesis — to scientifically uncover how to turn a company vision into a sustainable business model.

# Chapter in one sentence

1.  **START:** Startups have a lot of uncertainty, but this does not exclude them from requiring management of a portfolio. Instead, this management must focus on rapid inspection and adaptation in line with a vision — actively encouraging failure to quickly validate testable predictions.
2.  **DEFINE:** Leadership must move away from traditional management paradigms, working instead to establish a strong vision, and then creating an environment that supports entrepreneurship and experimentation in a build-measure-learn cycle for all of its employees in pursuit of that vision.
3.  **LEARN:** Lean startups need to use validated learning as their primary measure of progress — treating all business decisions as experiments to validate, focusing on understanding if the product should be built, and can form a sustainable business model.
4.  **EXPERIMENT:** The goal of a startup is to maximise learning through validation of key hypothesis, and rapid build-measure-learn cycles to rapidly obtain validated learning and inform the creation of sustainable business model in line with the target vision.
5.  **LEAP:** Identify leap of faith assumptions that are critical to the success or failure, carefully select and rapidly test key assumptions to adapt and hone in on the value and growth factors, and the customer archetype that will support and direct your strategy.
6.  **TEST:** Focus on building an MVP that isn’t necessarily a working product, but whatever mechanism you can identify that ensures the fastest possible cycle through the build-measure-learn loop to validate business hypothesis.
7.  **MEASURE:** Create a stream of actionable, accessible, and auditable measurements to test your fundamental assumptions — leveraging the results to inform your next build-measure-learn cycle.
8.  **PIVOT:** Companies must be cognizant when it is time to pivot — and carefully make a selection on which type of pivot to make. Once made, the pivot should be treated as a new strategic hypothesis that needs to be tested and validated through an MVP.
9.  **BATCH:** Lean start-ups need to focus on smaller batch sizes and automation — allowing fast movement through the Build-Measure-Learn cycle, obtaining feedback and learnings faster.
10.  **GROW:** Drive customer growth through the actions of past customers, identifying your growth engine (Sticky/Viral/Paid) and carefully tracking appropriate metrics for your specific growth engine.
11.  **ADAPT:** Develop an adaptive organization that can regularly inspect and adapt how it is operating — supporting and empowering teams to execute on business needs in a careful balance between speed and quality.
12.  **INNOVATE:** To truly innovate— establish innovation teams within a frame, give them independence, security of resources, and a personal stake in the outcome — affording the team to be able to safely work through the Build-Measure-Learn cycle.

# Start

-   _“Entrepreneurship require a managerial discipline to harness the entrepreneurial opportunity we have been given”_
-   Don’t think of a business plan like building a rocket ship, where you must provide a precise series of instructions to prevent the tiniest error of launch — instead we should make plans that are adaptable, lean, and allow for constant adjustments based on the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.
-   _“A startup is a portfolio of activities” — in which a mix of supporting established customers and innovation must be balanced._

# Define

-   In traditional management failure to deliver results is a failure of planning or execution — where as lean startups recognize this failure, encourage it, and adapt to it to rapidly improve and adjust.
-   To create new products or service, innovation can come from a number of sources and not just technical endeavours¹
-   _“Innovation is a bottom-up, decentralized, and unpredictable thing, but that doesn’t mean it cannot be managed.”_
-   It’s the responsibility of leadership and management to create an environment that allows for innovative practices to flourish, removing the constraints, models, and thinking from traditional management practices that do not support the rapid Build-Measure-Learn cycle.
-   _“A company’s only sustainable path to long-term economic growth is to build an ‘innovation factory’ that uses Lean Startup techniques to create disruptive innovations on a continuous basis.”_

# Learn

-   Learning must be at the heart of a lean startup — understanding which elements of the strategy are realizing the established vision, what your customers truly want, and if your start-up remains on-track for establishing itself as a sustainable business.
-   _“Validating learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that the team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects.”_
-   For a lean startup, anything that does not contribute to rapid and validated learning is a form of waste and should be eliminated.
-   Focuses on getting faster learning loops that are appropriate for your product and vision — options include releasing code faster, finding ways to test assumptions with less investment, or even offering products to customers that doesn’t yet exist to validate interest — in all cases, the goal is to minimise the outlay to obtain validated learning.
-   (A lean startup needs to) _“find a synthesis between our vision and what customers would accept; it wasn’t to capitulate to what customers thought they wanted or to tell customers what they ought to want.”_
-   _“The question is not ‘Can this product be built?’ — In the modern economy, almost any product that can be imagined can be built. The more pertinent questions are ‘Should this product be built?’ and ‘Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?’.”_
-   The lean startup model sees all decisions as Build-Measure-Learn loop to obtain validated learning — be it products, marketing, features, anything — all of it is considered and experiment.
-   _“If you cannot fail, you cannot learn”_
-   Break down vision into component parts to test — focusing on validating two key hypothesis informing growth potential:

1. Value Hypothesis — Does this actually deliver the intended value to your target customer?2. Growth Hypothesis — How will customers discover and adopt your product?

# Experiment

-   The goal of experimentation is to iterate on an emerging product, establishing early adopters, iterating on feedback, and refining value — ensuring that your product is actively being used to solve real customer problems well before a broader market launch is made.
-   Four key questions for teams to answer before development of a product:

1. Do customers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?3. Would they buy it from us?4. Can we built a solution for that problem?

-   _“Planning is a tool that only works in the presence of a long and stable operating history”_

The Build-Measure-Learn Cycle

-   Focus efforts in reducing the time through the Build-Measure-Learn loop — rapidly identifying the right hypothesis to test, and pushing to obtain validated learning on it.

# Leap

-   Prioritize validating the riskiest assumptions (leap-of-faith assumptions) of your startups plan first, before starting to build an MVP.
-   An MVP needs to establish a product that rapidly turns a full cycle of the Build-Measure-Learn loop in the least amount of effort possible — ready to provide data and validated learning to inform the next cycle.
-   “Startups need to conduct experiments that help determine what techniques will work in their unique circumstances. For startups, the role of strategy is to help figure out the right questions to ask.”

# Test

-   Consider analogs and antilogs when looking to validate assumptions:

Analogs — Patterns from other products or services that can be applied to validate an assumptionAntilogs — Anti-patterns from other products or services that can be applied to disprove an assumption

-   _“What differentiates the success stories from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly.”_
-   Don’t take data for granted through reports and metrics — get out and validate it first hand by directly interacting with the customers who will use your product or service
-   An MVP isn’t about building small — it’s about ensuring you have the fastest possible cycle through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimal amount of effort.
-   _“An MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.”_
-   MVP doesn’t need to be a working product, even in a crude form. It can be a website, a video, a marketing pitch — whatever it takes to test your fundamental business hypothesis quickly.
-   Quality is only important once the company has validated its learnings and knows what the customer really wants and needs — until we know the customer, we cannot know the quality.
-   _“The Lean Startup method is not opposed to building high-quality products, but only in service of the goal of winning over customers.”_
-   Don’t fear having your idea stolen — it’s a challenge to get your product noticed in the first place, let alone a competitor. The goal is to move through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than your competitors can (else, your product is doomed)
-   “A startup’s job is to (1) rigorously measure where it is right now, confronting the hard truth that assessment reveals, and then (2) devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan.”

# Measure

-   Innovation accounting is required to identify and measure the key growth drivers of your particular product or service, in light of the market it exists.
-   There are three steps to innovation accounting:

1. Use an MVP to establish data on where your product is right now2. Tune the product from its baseline towards the ideal3. Assess the progress — if aligned with the ideal, then continue forward. If not, pivot.

-   There are three information radiators that drive innovation accounting²:

1. Customer Focused Dashboards2. Leap-of-faith Assumption Dashboards3. Net Present Value Dashboards

-   “Every product development, marketing, or other initiative that a startup undertakes should be targeted at improving one of the drivers of its growth model”
-   Cohort analysis is the act of segmenting each group of customers that come into contact with the product independently — eg. the amount that register but don’t login is one cohort, the amount that actually login is another. This helps the business establish causality to its tuning.
-   _“Poor quantitative results force us to declare failure and create the motivation, context, and space for more qualitative research”_
-   Evidence of a sustainable business model can only assessed with clear tangible predictions made to test ahead of time.
-   Split testing, or A/B testing, aims at introducing a change to half of your target customers, while leaving the other half unchanged. Measuring the real impact of your changes against the baseline of remaining as-is.
-   There are three A’s of good metric reporting:

1. Actionable — Demonstrates clear cause and effect, providing a clear actionable outcome.2. Accessible — Easily explained and understood by the audience, ideally focusing on simple language and cohort based metrics.3. Auditable — Ensure the data is credible, and can be easily reproduced and validated.

# Pivot

-   It requires vision, intuition, and judgement to understand when sufficient progress against the original hypothesis isn’t being met, and a pivot is required.
-   _“The problem with the notion of shipping a product and then seeing what happens is that you are guaranteed to success — at seeing what happens.”_
-   Some types of pivot include:

1. Zoom-in — Refocusing the product on just one feature of a larger whole2. Zoom-out — Refocusing your product to be a feature of a broader product3. Customer segment — Keeping the functionality, but changing the audience of focus (MVP to mainstream customers, or small to big customers)4. Customer need — Identifying that the problem your solving for a customer isn’t as important as another, so moving to target the area of higher need5. Platform pivot — Offering your product as a self-serve platform, over a direct to customer solution (or vice versa)6. Business architecture — From high margin/low volume to low margin/high volume.7. Value capture — Finding new ways to capture value (typically via monetization or revenue models) created by your product8. Engine of growth — Shifting between one of the primary growth models; viral, sticky, and paid growth.9. Channel — Targeting an alternate sales or distribution channel to deliver the solution with greater effectiveness10. Technology — Achieving the same solution using different technology, to provide super price and/or performance

-   Think of the startup runway as the total number of pivots the company can make — focusing on getting pivots faster by decreasing the time/cost of validated learning.
-   Establish a frequent schedule of “pivot or persevere” meetings to objectively assess the results with product and business teams, deciding on the path forward.
-   Don’t forget that the core purpose of all the optimizing, tuning, and iterating are to test _“a clear hypothesis in the service of the company’s vision”_
-   A pivot isn’t just a change — it _“is better understood as a new strategic hypothesis that will require a new minimum viable product to test”_

# Batch

-   To keep focused on how much investment should be made in infrastructure, planning, incentives, marketing, sales and other investments — should all be made through the lense of lean practices, aiming to avoid the 7 types of waste³, focusing on obtaining validated learning.
-   Create speed and small batches by establishing cross-functional teams to work together to rapidly deliver an MVP increment through the Build-Measure-Learn loop.
-   We need to focus on pulling through our value chain experiments that need to be run, for single-piece flow, reducing waste in the form of work-in-progress (aka. inventory)

# Grow

-   _“Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from the actions of past customers.”_
-   The four primary ways past customers drive growth:

1. Word of mouth2. As a side effect of product usage (eg. driving awareness)3. Through funded advertising4. Through repeat purchase or use

-   Three engines of growth exist which aim to get startups to focus on a small set of valuable metrics, on which to place their energy:

1. Sticky — Attract and retain customers long-term2. Viral — Awareness spreads rapidly from person to person transmission3. Paid — Selling the product to the customer, keeping the cost to acquire is less than the revenue generated

-   Sticky growth engines need to track attrition rate/churn rate carefully. If customer acquisition exceed churn, the business is growing. Focus on creating incentives for customers to stay.
-   Viral growth need to track the viral loop for feedback, checking to see what the viral coefficient is. _“It (viral coefficient) measures how many new customers will use the product as a consequency of each new customer who signs up”._ This loop needs to be better than 1.0 (one new customer recruited by each existing customer) for a sustainable viral growth engine.
-   Paid growth has the goal to keep the cost per acquisition (CPA) of customers as low as possible, and/or increase the revenue per customer. In either case, the goal is to increase the Lifetime value (LTV) — which is the total revenue captured by the customer, less how much the CPA was. The ability to grow will require the ability to _“monetize a certain set of customers”_
-   Work towards achieving a product/market fit⁴, using innovation accounting and appropriate growth metrics to validate

# Adapt

-   The goal is to build an adaptive organization — _“one that automatically adjusts its processes and performance to current conditions”_
-   _“You cannot trade quality for time” —_ the quality sacrifices you make now will cause defects that slow you down in the future.
-   The key is finding a balance between quality and speed, adapting to the needs of the organization at any given time using the Five Whys
-   _“make a proportional investment at each of the five levels of the hierarchy”_. Small investment for small problems, large investment for large problems.
-   “The Five Whys approach acts as a natural speed regulator. The more problems you have, the more you invest in solutions to those problems”
-   To use Five Whys effectively, you need:

1. Everyone affected by the problem is part of the process, from support, all the way through the organization to management.2. Trust and empowerment to the group3. Leadership holding the team accountable to set and achieve actions from the session4. Be consistent in having meetings as new problems come up5. At the start of each session — reinforce what the process is for now and how it works

-   Root cause analysis can pull people apart, Five Whys aims to bring them together.
-   _“Lean management requires treating work as a system and then dealing with the batch size and cycle time of the whole process.”_

# Innovate

-   Startup teams require three structural attributes:

1. Independent development authority2. Scarce but secure resources3. A personal stake in the outcome

-   _“Startups are both easier and more demanding to run than traditional divisions: they require much less capital overall, but that capital must be absolutely secure from tampering.”_
-   Hand-offs slow the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop — reduce this by creating empowered, cross functional teams.
-   Personal stake in the outcome isn’t necessarily about financial rewards — leverage the key motivators of autonomy, mastery, and purpose⁵ to create truly engaged teams.
-   You will need to _“protect the parent organization from the startup”_ by creating an innovation sandbox — constraining the impact of innovation, but not constrain the methods.
-   Innovation sandboxes allow any team to create an A/B test that affects a sandboxed part of a product or service, so long as:

1. That one team can see the experiment through end-to-end2. It’s time boxed to a short duration3. It’s customer impact is constrained to minimize impact4. Each experiment is evaluated on a single standard report of five to ten actionable metrics (ie. innovation accounting)5. Every team working inside the sandbox uses the same metrics to evaluate success6. Any team that creates an experiment owns the monitoring of metrics and customer feedback while the experiment is in progress

-   _“With an internal startup team, the sequence of accountability is the same: build an ideal model of the desired disruption that is based on customer archetypes, launch a minimum viable product to establish a baseline, and then attempt to tune the engine to get it closer to the ideal.”_
-   _“The Lean Startup is a framework, not a blueprint of steps to follow. It is designed to be adapted to the conditions of each specific company.”_
