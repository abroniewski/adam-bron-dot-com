# Meeting Summary – Grant Automation Tool: Discovery & Drafting  
**Date:** 30 April 2025

---

## Overview  
This meeting explored the concept and feasibility of developing a tool to support Austyn’s grant writing business. The goal is to reduce manual workload and increase lead conversion by automating two key activities: identifying relevant grant opportunities and producing first-draft applications.

---

## Key Objectives Discussed  

### 1. Grant Opportunity Discovery
- **Challenge:** Tracking open grants is time-consuming due to inconsistent formats, hidden portals, and staggered timelines across platforms.
- **Proposed Solution:** A centralized grant **database** that automatically scrapes and updates listings from curated sources. Includes a **notification system** for new or matching opportunities.
- **Notes:**
  - Some sites require login or 2FA — a **semi-automated approach** may be used initially.
  - Process begins with client intake to identify funding needs and filters relevant results accordingly.

### 2. First-Draft Application Generator
- **Challenge:** Each grant has unique formatting and submission requirements, often housed in proprietary portals.
- **Proposed Solution:** Combine standardized company info with grant templates to generate a **starting draft**.
- **Strategic Use:** First drafts can also act as **lead generation tools** during cold outreach — offering prospective clients real value upfront.

## Pricing Model Context
- **Current Market Rates:**
  - Expression of Interest: ~$700  
  - Full Application: ~$1,000–$1,200  
  - Full-service packages range from **$5,000–$10,000** per grant.
- Automation would offset costs, **increase client capacity**, and enable more consistent quality across applications.

---

## Strategic Considerations
- Austyn is evaluating different structures for moving forward (independent venture, partnership with Rachel, or team-based setup).
- The PoC will begin as a **personal productivity tool**, with potential to scale as a platform.
- Potential collaborators:
  - **Rachel** – Investor prospect.  
  - **Joanna Sadowska** – Content/writing support.

## Conclusion  
The session clarified a strong opportunity to streamline grant discovery and proposal drafting. By starting with a lean, personalized tool and validating value early, the project can grow sustainably. The next step is to evaluate technical feasibility based on real grant sources and outline a development plan.
