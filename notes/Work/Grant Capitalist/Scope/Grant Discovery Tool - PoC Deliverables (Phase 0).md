*Estimated Time: 1–2 days*

*This phase is exploratory and manual, focused on validating feasibility before building a full product.*

1. **Automated Grant Extraction from 2 Websites (Alberta Innovates & ESDC)**

   * Extract grant data from Alberta Innovates and ESDC (websites already provided by Austyn).
   * Title, deadline, summary/description, and source link extracted.
   * Output refreshed from live site (not hardcoded).

2. **Structured Output File**

   * Google Sheet or Airtable with columns: Title, Deadline, Summary, Link, Date Retrieved, Date Updated.
   * Easy to scan, filter, and sort.

3. **Run Script or Notebook**

   * A working script or Jupyter Notebook that can be re-run to refresh the data.
   * Bonus: Includes basic logging (e.g. “10 grants found”, “Last updated on…”).

4. **One-Click View for Austyn**

   * Shared Google Sheet or Airtable link she can open and explore without setup.
   * Bonus: Include a few sample tags or colour-coding to show future potential.

5. **Feasibility Report (Short Write-up)**

   * Notes on how easy/hard it was to extract data from each site.
   * Known limitations (e.g. no summary on Site B, dynamic content on Site A).
   * Suggested improvements for next phase.

6. **Success Criteria Checklist**

   * A quick checklist showing that the PoC met expectations:

     * Was it possible to extract grants?
     * Did we capture the right info?
     * Do we have the information required to plan and estimate required effort for the Phase 1 Pilot tool?
     * What would make this more useful?

7. **Review & Next Steps**

   * Review results together and plan pilot scope based on findings from the PoC.
