**Topic:** Proof of Concept Review & Next Steps for Grant Automation Tool

### 🔍 Summary of Discussion

Austyn and Adam discussed the delivered proof of concept (POC) for automating grant discovery and tracking. The conversation covered both strategic directions and technical implementations for scaling the idea into a service or platform. Key highlights:

#### ✅ POC Features Demonstrated

* Successful scraping of Alberta Innovates and ESDC data
* Detection of new/updated grants and change tracking
* Storage in Airtable database
* Possibility to automate notifications and email generation

#### 🔧 Grant Discovery Needs

* Track open/closed status, deadlines, and cycles
* Include project and company eligibility (location, size, revenue)
* Identify allowable costs and matching requirements
* Support auto-emailing to grant contacts asking about future calls
* Provide a roadmap (timeline) and a grant "cheat sheet" for clients

#### 💡 Strategic Use Cases Discussed

1. **Outreach Tool**: Auto-generate artifacts (1-pagers, timelines) for cold outreach
2. **Client Dashboard**: Provide personalized grant notifications and tracking
3. **Lead Gen Landing Page**: Simple intake form to match users with grants
4. **Internal Prospecting Tool**: Help Austyn quickly identify grant fits for leads

### 🧭 Potential Directions
