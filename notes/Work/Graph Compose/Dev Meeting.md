- AI investment could be cautious conservative given rise of AI development
- Looked at other options and looks like it remains a compoetitive tool
- NEED: Help growing + getting trainined now so that when validated needs to find people. Wants people to be in and comfortable with codebase

Wants to get some small sections builtup as a gateway to getting comfortable with codebase overall.
Could compensate at $20-30/hr along with training.
Jason is gonna get contract for 3months, goal remains to launch this and make it a business.

If it works, 2 issues:
1. awesome idea
2. competitors exist
3. building products happens fast, might need to exit quickly

- endpoints in express server
- each path is a node (because it takes in inputs, and return outputs)
- openAPI spec is the standard of how APIs can represent themselves. There are lots of visualisers for this format.

Add the most commonly used nodes:
GPT: what are the most common providers? Niche down into well used industries that aren't well supported in zapier. 
 eg. nodes for runway or kling for video
How? Go to API deocumentation, copy/paste the info, Cursor: I want a new route.
VALUE: Identifying the new routes, 5 video providers + services that might be useful to onboard people.

First steps:
- get into node github
- start server
- get started in postman
- start with a niche (video tooling)
	- generally, create nodes for the most popular tools being used, currently videos and images
	- next, replicate node (most popular models)
	- then, what times of operations do these poeple use (CDNs for image or video serving, image transformation)
	- + very common points like sendGrid and some new alternatives.
Expectations: it takes a few hours to get through and building the first node.
