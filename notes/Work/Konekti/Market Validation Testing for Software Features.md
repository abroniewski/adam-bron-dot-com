I built a matrix that lists out all of the software features that have been developed in the Konekti platform. Some of them are architectural considerations, some of them roll up together and form higher level features.
I also listed out the strategic benefits that Konekti provides to users.
All of these features are numbered items that exists in a single worksheet.

In another worksheet, I mapped out how the features roll up into each other, and how certain operational features in the software contribute to the high level benefits that I can use in marketing material and sales call.

The big idea here is to be able to use this as a way to test our assumptions and do market validation systematically. What will come of this is that when I'm on a discovery call, I'll be able to quickly decide on which parts of the software to demonstrate to get traction and show how we help resolve an issue.

I'll then review and debrief on the call to determine if my assumption that "Feature X" contribute to "Benefit Y" is true or not. Wherever it's true, we can double down on marketing those things and continuing to demonstrate it.

Overtime this also helps make sure our dev team is developing the right features for the platform to help our users.
