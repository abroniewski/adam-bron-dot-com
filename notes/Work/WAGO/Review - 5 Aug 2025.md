# Document Generation
- correct number of I/O modules in intro paragprah of markdown and PDF
- updated GET address to be descriptive and appropriate. Looks good for CSV download, but PDF and makrdown dont make sense (download vs markdown?typ=download vs markdown?type=preview)
- change generated filenames to WAGO_BOM_datetime.pdf, WAGO_BOM_datetime.txt, and and WAGO_configurator_input_datetime.csv
- For the PDF: make line spacing compact
- Markdown: fix bullet points
- add WAGO logo and styling to PDF

# UI
- in AI config, remove "back to home" and keep navbar at top
- when there is not enough info to generate BOM, have text in generate BOM button indicate there isn't yet enough info
- ~~**send button in chat is not visible.**~~

# Selection Engine
- add preferences for -10 to +10 and 4-10mA
