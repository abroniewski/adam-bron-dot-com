### 1. 9:15–9:25 — Introductions & Background Exchange

**Purpose:** Build rapport, establish mutual context

1. **You share (3–4 min)**

   * Your journey (engineering → startup → Huddly)
   * Where Huddly is now: early-stage, design/planning, website & product shaping
   * Honest take on what’s clear and what’s still in progress

2. **Prompt him (5–6 min)**

   > “Tell me a bit about your background and what you're looking for in this phase.”
   > “What brought you to Huddly, and what kind of experience are you hoping to get?”

---

### 2. 9:25–9:35 — Motivation & Value Exchange

**Purpose:** Understand what energizes him and how to make this mutually valuable

3. > “What kinds of projects or problems get you excited?”
4. > “If you could design your ideal internship here, what would you want to work on?”
5. > “What would make this experience valuable for *you* — something you’d walk away from proud of?”

---

### 3. 9:35–9:45 — Working Style & Support Needs

**Purpose:** Learn how to support him effectively

6. > “What kind of environment helps you do your best work — solo with check-ins, close collaboration, async freedom?”
7. > “What level of guidance or mentorship do you prefer?”
8. > “Can you share a moment or project where you felt like you were thriving? What conditions made that possible?”

### 4. 9:45–9:55 — Feedback Loop Logic + AI Tooling

**Purpose:** Explore how he thinks and how he uses AI in real work

**Frame lightly**:

> “One area I think you could bring real value is helping us figure out how to track what’s working — like which nudges or features actually help users move forward — and using that feedback to shape what we build next.”

9. > “If you were building a system to track whether users are progressing and what’s driving that, how would you approach it?”
10. > “What types of data would you want to collect or monitor?”
11. > “How would you evaluate whether a feature or recommendation is doing its job?”

**Then transition to tooling:**
12\. > “When you're working through something like this, how do you use AI tools in your workflow?”
13\. > “Do you use ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot — anything like that?”
14\. > “How do you balance writing things yourself vs. using AI to speed up or shape your thinking?”

### 5. 9:55–10:00 — Open Q\&A + Wrap-Up

**Purpose:** Leave space for his questions and align on next steps

15. > “Any questions for me — about Huddly, the team, or how we work?”
16. > “Really enjoyed this — I’ll follow up with Brett and Fatima, and we’ll be in touch soon about next steps.”

# Notes
- Main exposure
	- Quality Assurance
	- SaaS companies -> web apps
		- tested product flows, bug fixes, documentation
- looking for quantum -> foothold
- what he's looking for:
	- experiment + test out known/ unknown
	- understand where skill sets lies
- ML and AI models out of scope
- career path:
	- middleman between business and tech
- environment needs:
	- spends some time ruminating, think things through to work on own
	- clear direction, what the objectives are
	- open and honest feedback -> being told whether on the right path or something to improve
- very detail oriented -> QA matches personality, but was tedious
- Scoring
	- what are we looking to score
	- what aspects to use
	- setting up framework -> more comfortable here
		- what parts of the business
