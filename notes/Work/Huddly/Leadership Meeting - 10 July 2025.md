ACTION ITEMS
Fatima - Create 3 map roadmap
Adam - admin accounts
Adam - contract


- imperial "we"



- NDA really needed
- is login the way it should be? -> whats the workflow
- wiki
- communication
	- keep convos in correct thread
		- difficult to track or find things if not in correct place
	- context and details (links to website, message links etc.)
		- feels like the need to organise gets pushed to the recipient -> its ok if we are aligned that it then takes me time to hunt everything down
	-
- daily standup -> is this the correct thing to do? If so, what is blocker from using?
- budgets -> what happened? does something need to change?
	-  design and workflow decisions -> if not explicit, it takes me time to then decide what should be done
