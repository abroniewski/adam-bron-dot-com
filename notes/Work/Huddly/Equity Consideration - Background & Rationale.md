# Context

I began contributing to Huddly AI’s vision in the summer of 2024, gradually increasing my involvement through the fall and into the early phases of product development. By March 2025, we began working under a functional draft of our current services agreement.

Since then, I’ve been contributing to Huddly AI as Chief Technology Officer through my consultancy, Moving Data Insights B.V. While I’ve been compensated hourly for technical development work, I have also had significant contributions that were unpaid and self-directed; focused on strategic planning, aligning on product-market fit, developing internal structures, hiring, and more. These activities resemble the kind of unpaid, high-leverage work typically performed by early-stage founders.

It’s important to note:

> **All of these unpaid hours were undertaken voluntarily.**
> Huddly AI has never asked or required me to perform unpaid work.
> I chose to do so in support of the company’s long-term vision, and I plan to continue doing so in alignment with that vision.

To fairly recognise this founder-level contribution, I’ve drafted an equity arrangement using a **Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE)**.

## Logic Behind the Numbers

### Indexing Against Founders

I’ve assumed that roughly **20–30% of the company** is earmarked for co-founders, and for planning purposes, I’ve chosen a midpoint assumption of **25%** split evenly between Brett and Fatima. This results in an estimated **12.5% each**.

My goal is to **index my equity to approximately half** of one founder’s stake. That brings me to **4.25%**, which I believe reflects both the value and part-time nature of my involvement while still keeping me emotionally aligned as a peer and co-leader.

### Building Towards That Percentage

To reach this 4.25% equity mark, I needed to calculate a notional value for my unpaid hours. I started by assuming a **\$4 million CAD company valuation** and worked backward to define the hourly rate that would get me to my target equity amount by the end of 2025.

The result was a **notional rate of \$200 CAD/hour**, which is higher than the \$150/hour CAD that would be typical for this type of role based on experience and market comparisons. I chose to increase the rate so that the cumulative equity aligns with the 4.25% benchmark by year-end.

I also assumed that starting in **January 2026**, we will all move to equal salaries of **\$120,000 CAD/year**, and I included that expected cash compensation in my total compensation modelling. The equity compensation via SAFE fills the gap for unpaid work in 2025.

### Market-Aligned Terms

The SAFE is structured to follow **standard investor terms**:

* **20% discount** on valuation at time of conversion
* **No expiration**
* **Conversion at a \$250,000 CAD Qualified Financing trigger**
* **Four-year vesting** with a **one-year cliff**, retroactive to March 2025

These terms communicate long-term alignment while preserving flexibility and fairness to the company’s future investors.

### Summary of Intent

* I’m not looking to “match” Brett or Fatima.
* I *am* looking to index myself to a **clear, fair proportion** of founder equity to reflect my long-term, self-directed contributions.
* The specific dollar values may shift as the company evolves, but the logic—anchored in contribution and alignment—remains the same.
* This SAFE structure is meant to honour and record that contribution in a transparent, investor-friendly, and trust-driven way.
