## **Founder Signing Up and Getting Matched with Investors**

### **1. [Founder] Signup with the Chatbot**
- A founder shares their goals and needs with a chatbot, which gathers just enough information to provide a preview of the matches the founder has with potential investors. The founder experiences the value that can be provided before signing up.
- The founder is asked to sign up through email or single-click (using SSO) and is taken to their personalized dashboard, where they can get more information about the potential investors they've matched with.
- The founder is shown 3 potential investors they’ve been matched with, along with their match scores (displayed as a percentage).
- On their dashboard, they can see an indicator of their profile completeness.
### **2. [Founder] Viewing Investors and Connecting**
- When the founder clicks on a potential investor, they get some basic information about them and are asked if they want to connect.
- If the founder chooses to connect, they are guided through the process of providing additional information about their startup that the investor needs to decide if they are a good fit.
- A visual indicator shows how much time/effort it will take to complete the connection request.
- The chatbot gives a general overview of the required information and asks the founder to upload any supporting documents they already have (e.g., pitch decks, research papers, previous grant applications).
- If there are missing details, the chatbot explicitly asks for the information in a conversational format.
### **3. [Founder] Investor Memo Generation**
- When the chatbot has enough information, it shows the founder a draft version of the investor memo for review to ensure accuracy.
- The founder can make changes but is encouraged not to worry about formatting or language, as the final memo will be drafted by AI to follow a uniform style and format.
- The memo includes a list of key technologies underpinning the startup and any products or services the startup is commercializing.
- Only one memo is generated, which is used across all investor connections.
### **4. [Founder] Sending the Memo**
- The founder clicks "Go/Approve" to send the memo. After a brief loading screen, they see a confirmation that the request has been sent.
- A search is completed on google scholar on the key technologies identified to generate a visualization in the research trends in those areas. The intent is to show investors how much new research exists in the area.
- The investor memo includes explanations of key technologies underpinning the startup and identifies implementation risks for areas that have not been seen commercialized before.
- The founder is informed they will hear back within 5 days.
- The founder is returned to their dashboard, where they can see a status indicator showing the investor's review is in progress.
### **5. [Founder] Limiting Requests**
- The founder can repeat the process with up to 2 potential investors at a time, as they are limited to having 2 reach-outs in progress simultaneously.
- The founder can gain access to additional investor matches and more in-progress requests by referring other founders or investors to the platform. Each referral unlocks new opportunities.
### **6. [Founder] Reacting to Investor Responses**
- The founder receives a response from the investor via email and sees a visual notification on their dashboard.
- The dashboard's status for that specific investor is updated.
- If the investor has clarifying questions, the founder provides answers through the chatbot, which drafts a response for the founder to review and send.
- If the response is a "No," the founder receives feedback on why, along with an updated, more suitable match based on the feedback.
- If the response is a "Yes," the founder sees 3 meeting time slots proposed by the investor and selects one. A meeting invite with a virtual link is sent to both parties.
