Would not do data processing in bubble platform. Build API for the process, these can be called by Bubble. 
- user authentication can all be kept in bubble.
- what functionality do we need to show investors. Can treat some of the platform as manual.
	- including a chatbot for founder onboarding would be interesting for investors

Small design studio
likes to be involved from beginning at a high level.
how to split it, made smaller, prioritize.
start with first project, then stay involved with 
- small retainer or fractional team (people working part time always)
- design to development
- bubble really good for initial launch.
- **lovable.dev** -> supabase backend with AI prompting

NEXT STEPS:
Send roadmap + MVP +demo scope to Mike Mike Wiendels - Organizer
