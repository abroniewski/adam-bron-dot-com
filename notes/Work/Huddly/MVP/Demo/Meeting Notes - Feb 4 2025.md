# The Problem
- Deep Tech is the context
11. Connecting with the right people is difficult
	1. competitive and overcrowded landscape for both startups and investors
12. Investors -> deal sourcing and fundraising is crowded
13. talent acquisition
- User (founder) typically uses LinkedIn
	- the founders outreach, when cold outreach, always goes back to this place
## Founder User Problem
- finding reliable partners (cofounders, mentors, business partner, fractional CEO)
- finding funding
### Case Study: Andres looking for funding
Andres has been through YCombinator and has co-founded 2 AI ventures. Works as AI consultant for company in spain.
- on LinkedIn with direct outreach, gets response 10% of the time
- Crunchbase is not curated enough
	- lots of content and information
	- lots of bells and whistles
	- not user friendly
	- type in criteria and get a list
	- site has scraped info and reformats data in a way that they think should streamline things, but still an issue
- doesn't want to look at list of 50, wants 3-5
- investors should include previous investments/startups. A bit of a portfolio. Almost always found on website, but not directly in the platform.
	- either reachout through linkedin or look at website.
		- website shows portfolio that is fairly broad
		- sometimes hard to see what the industry is that a company is focused on
		- can look at the companies they have backed and then reverse engineer that to see what the REAL focus is.
- DeepTech and Quantum area will continue to expand overtime
## Investor User Problem
- crowded landscape of startups -> finding a startup that meets the requirements of the investor is time consuming or costly.
	- Angel investors -> start with inner circle, then go to crunchbase or something, and then struggle to find the right people.
- uncertain where to start in connecting (invest? buy or use product?)
- fundraising is hard. Lots of time and effort to recruit investors. 

# Demo Function
- Objective: Include something tangible in the pre-seed pitch deck. Pre-seed funding will be used to build MVP. Goal is to get investment, support, warm connections, have people interested in using the product.
- Who: VCs and connections that can get us pre-seed.
- Demonstrate: founder matching to investor and investor matching to investor
- What do they interact with:
	- Main website
	- interact with chatbot -> ok to keep it simple. can provide them instructions on whats allowed
	- create a rough profile card 
		- with basic criteria
		- upload pitchdeck PDF
	- User sees example of investment memo. This is a real investment memo created from the actual inputs.
		- fake the trending data/ visualization for research trending
		- we can fake the gaps in the investment memo
	- dashboard
		- bubbles and placeholders OK
		- shows curated matches

- ChatGPT API KEY: OPENAI-API-KEY-HERE

There isn't anything on the frontend that we need to use.

### Notes
- what is included in Loom video is good as the step 1
- dashboard needs to have a minimal approach that gives the least amount of information possible to move forward.
	- cut through including all of the background info
	- curate everything as much as possible.

# MVP Function
- founding team
- job seekers finding jobs (job board)
