## **2. Detailed Scope & Feature Overview**

### **Core Features to be Delivered**

| **Feature**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Website**                    | A simple landing page where the user is greeted by a chatbot to setup their profile.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Chatbot Interaction**             | Users interact with a chatbot that guides them through the demo. The chatbot is allowed to fill in missing gaps. The bot will establish the user type (founder or investor) and get information needed for matching.                     |
| **Profile Creation**                | A **profile card** is generated based on the information the user provided that will be used for matching.                                                                                                                               |
| **Matching**                        | 3 potential matches appear based on the user's profile and objective. These matches use dummy data.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Pitch Deck Upload**               | Users can upload a **PDF pitch deck** as part of their profile.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Investment Memo Generation**      | Demo will showcase an **example investment memo**, created from actual user inputs and uploaded pitch deck. The client must provide a visual draft of the investment memo format. If not provided, a best approximation will be drafted. |
| **Trending Data Visualization**     | **Fake** trending research data will be generated for the investment memo.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Dashboard with Matching Results** | A simple **dashboard** will display **matches** and a chatbot that can support the user with next steps.                                                                                                                                 |

## **6.Setting Expectations – What This Demo Can & Can’t Do**

This demo is all about giving investors a **hands-on feel** for Huddly.ai. It’s a **work in progress**, designed for iteration and expansion. Here’s what to expect:

### **General**

- It’ll be **hosted online** so you can access it easily.
- The backend is **modular**, meaning we can **build on it later** as needed.
- We are making use of components that were built previously.
- **No data saves between sessions**—everything resets on refresh.
- Uploaded files are **temporary**—they won’t be stored beyond a single session.
- **Desktop only**—not optimized for mobile.
- The demo expects users to follow a **structured flow**—going off-track **may cause errors**.
- Once you input details, **you can’t go back and tweak them** (at least for now).

### **Chatbot & Matching**

- The chatbot is **fully conversational** and moves across pages within a session.
- Matches feel **personalized** (thanks to LLM magic), but there’s **no real matchmaking logic**—it’s all demo data.

### **Pitch Deck & Investment Memo**

- You can upload a **pitch deck**, and the system will **extract real content** from it.
- The investment memo is **auto-generated**—no edits, no multiple versions.

### **Dashboard & Navigation**

- You can **click on matches** to see more details.
- You can **move between the dashboard and profiles**, but **not edit your profile** once created.

---

## **Next Steps**

- **Approval:** Confirm acceptance of the scope and pricing.
- **Kickoff:** Begin development upon email confirmation.
- **Delivery & Review:** Provide updates, gather feedback, and finalize the demo within the three-week period (March 7th).
