Workflow demo looks good
Fastest way to get revenue
- API tool for lead generation
	- something that can get connected to other places
- Document creation
	- separate it out of the workflow
	- doesn't have to flow through the webpage
		- pay per use for the document
	- Investment memos
		- founders are encouraged to make them to understand how their company looks on paper
		- VCs pay their analysts to do this
- Pitch deck review
	- paid service, would have done that

## Pain Points
LinkedIn sales navigator sucks
warm connections are hush deals you get in late
something centralized to organize the documents
- data room -> master file of all the important information on a company
- business plan
- financials
- operations documnents
- IP
- anything pertaining to legal and financial purposes

DEMO: Show a popup on LinkedIn -> a seperate window/ helper.
