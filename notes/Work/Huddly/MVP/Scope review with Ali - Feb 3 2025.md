- management is missing
- functions can't all be build in parallel
- graph approach -> way too early to use this
	- start with a way simpler approach
	- start with a narrow field/approach and then build out and expand. Start with simple architecture and then go out to state of the art.
- data model is fundamental
	- the approach we take is a core value
- What to remove:
	- anything depending on AI
	- remove research labs and how to integrate
	- anything related to generating documents. Processing information on AI has a large budget that is not the core value.
- Demo:
	- UI/UX
	- algorithm already exists


Need to be working with someone who has been working in startup that has hit the first management level.
