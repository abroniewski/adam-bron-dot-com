Here are the most relevant sections in **EU Regulation 651/2014 (AGVV)** that refer to intellectual property rights (IPR) and ownership in the context of subsidies such as the MIT Zuid feasibility grant:

---

### **1. Recital (46) — Page 10**

> _"Steun voor haalbaarheidsstudies en innovatiesteun voor kmo’s — met inbegrip van steun ter dekking van kosten voor industriële eigendomsrechten — kan een oplossing bieden voor die problemen en dient daarom, onder bepaalde voorwaarden, van de verplichting tot aanmelding te worden vrijgesteld."_

**Translation:**  
Support for feasibility studies and innovation for SMEs — including support covering **costs related to industrial property rights** — may address certain market failures and is therefore eligible for exemption from state aid notification.

**Implication:**  
This confirms that the **costs for acquiring or securing intellectual property** (e.g., patents) are eligible expenses, and there is no mention of ownership transfer — implying that IP generated remains with the SME, unless otherwise specified.

---

### **2. Article 2.30 — Page 22**

Defines **“immateriële activa”** (intangible assets) as:

> _"...zoals octrooien, licenties, knowhow of andere intellectuele-eigendomsrechten."_  
> (_"...such as patents, licenses, know-how, or other intellectual property rights."_)

This clarifies what falls under the scope of IP when referenced in later subsidy cost categories.

---

### **3. Article 25 (Research & Development Aid)**

Mentions **eligible costs may include:**

- **"Kosten voor de verwerving van intellectuele-eigendomsrechten"**
    
- These are **subsidizable**, but **nowhere in the regulation does it require that ownership be transferred to the funding agency.**
    

---

### **BOTTOM LINE:**

- You, as the beneficiary, **retain ownership of any IP you develop** during the MIT Zuid Feasibility Study.
    
- The regulation allows subsidies to **support the costs of acquiring or securing IP**, but does not require **open access or public ownership** of the resulting innovations.
    
- Ownership only changes if **you explicitly agree** (e.g., via subcontractor terms or licensing deals).
    


There is **no explicit statement** in EU Regulation 651/2014 (AGVV) that says:

> “The intellectual property developed under publicly funded support remains the property of the beneficiary.”

However, here’s what’s important:

### 1. **What the regulation _doesn’t_ say is just as important as what it does:**

- Nowhere does it state that **IP must be shared, made public, or transferred** due to public funding.
    
- There are **no provisions requiring open-source licensing, government ownership, or IP surrender** in return for receiving MIT Zuid or similar subsidies.
    

### 2. **By default under EU and Dutch subsidy frameworks:**

- **IP rights stay with the recipient (you)** unless **contractually reassigned**, which is common practice in national innovation funding schemes for SMEs.
    
- The AGVV mentions subsidizing **IP protection costs**, which **assumes the SME will own the IP**.
    

### 3. **Precedent and policy:**

- Dutch RVO, Stimulus, and MIT Zuid documentation typically emphasize commercialization, implying IP control remains with the applicant.
    
- If IP ownership was to be transferred or shared, it would be explicitly required — and it is not.
