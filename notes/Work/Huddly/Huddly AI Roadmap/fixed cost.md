# Structuring a Fixed-Cost Contract

When a client wants a **fixed-cost contract**, you need to carefully define **scope, deliverables, milestones, and payment terms** so both parties have clear expectations. Below is a recommended structure using the phased approach we’ve already discussed.

---

## 1. Define a Clear Statement of Work (SOW)

1. **Project Scope**  
   - Summarize the core objectives, features, and AI capabilities to be delivered.  
   - Reference specific functionalities (e.g., AI agent, matchmaking, recruitment portal) so there’s no ambiguity.

2. **Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria**  
   - For each deliverable, specify how the client will confirm acceptance (e.g., a demo, UAT sign-off).  
   - Example: “Investment Memo Generator is accepted when it can produce a data-rich memo from uploaded pitch decks and external data sources without errors.”

3. **Out of Scope Items**  
   - Identify features or scenarios that are *not* included in this contract (e.g., additional integrations or advanced analytics beyond described).  
   - This protects you from scope creep and clarifies that new requests may require a **change order**.

## 2. Phase-Based Milestones & Fixed Costs

Break the total project into **4 major phases** (aligned with the roadmap), each with its own **fixed cost**. This keeps payments tied to concrete progress and provides the client with transparency. An example breakdown:

| **Phase**                                  | **Deliverables**                                                                                                                     | **Fixed Cost** | **Estimated Timeline** |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------: | ---------------------- |
| **Phase 1**<br>*Discovery & Architecture*  | - Final requirements, architecture diagrams, high-fidelity wireframes<br>- Detailed project plan & risk assessment                   |       \$XX,XXX | 3–4 weeks              |
| **Phase 2**<br>*Core MVP Implementation*   | - User auth, basic AI chatbot, graph DB setup<br>- Early user dashboard & notifications                                              |       \$XX,XXX | 4–5 weeks              |
| **Phase 3**<br>*Advanced AI & Specialized* | - Matchmaking algorithms (founders, investors, etc.)<br>- Investment & Research Memos<br>- Recruitment Portal MVP, Opportunity Board |       \$XX,XXX | 3–4 weeks              |
| **Phase 4**<br>*Testing & Launch*          | - End-to-end testing, final deployment & documentation<br>- Post-launch support plan                                                 |       \$XX,XXX | 2–3 weeks              |

> **Total Fixed Cost** = Sum of all phase costs (including your contingency/buffer).

Each phase’s **fixed cost** factors in **time + resource effort + 20% contingency** on your side. Internally, you might track a detailed hour breakdown, but externally, you present a **lump-sum** per phase.

---

## 3. Contingency & Change Orders

1. **Built-In Contingency (20%)**  
   - For each phase, increase your internal cost estimate by ~20%.  
   - This covers minor scope adjustments, extra testing, or small feature tweaks without needing to constantly renegotiate.

2. **Change Orders**  
   - For **major** new features or significant scope changes, define a formal **change request** process.  
     - Outline how you’ll estimate additional cost/time.  
     - Agree on new or revised timelines and costs in writing before work begins.

By explicitly **separating minor vs. major changes**, the client knows you’re flexible for small tweaks but large changes will incur a structured process.

---

## 4. Payment Terms & Schedule

Link each **payment milestone** to completion of a phase. A common structure:

1. **Milestone 0**: **20%** upon contract signing (covers initial Discovery kickoff).  
2. **Milestone 1**: **30%** upon completion/acceptance of Phase 2 deliverables.  
3. **Milestone 2**: **30%** upon completion/acceptance of Phase 3 deliverables.  
4. **Milestone 3**: **20%** upon final acceptance and production launch (Phase 4).

This staggered schedule:

- Gives you **upfront cash flow** to staff the project.  
- Aligns payments with visible progress for the client.  
- Reserves a final portion until successful delivery and sign-off.

---

## 5. Handling Timeline Ranges

Even with a fixed cost, you should still present a **range of possible timelines**:

- **Best Case**: ~12 weeks  
- **Typical**: ~14 weeks  
- **Worst Case**: ~16 weeks

Explain to the client that each phase includes a **1–2 week buffer**. If everything goes smoothly, you’ll deliver closer to 12 weeks, but you have leeway for technical hurdles or user feedback.

---

## 6. Assumptions & Dependencies

Include a list of **assumptions** in the contract to protect both parties. For example:

- **Client Availability**: Feedback or approvals are provided within X days.  
- **3rd-Party Integrations**: APIs (LinkedIn, Scholar) are accessible and have no major delays or permissions issues.  
- **No Large Pivots**: The primary AI features remain the same as defined in the SOW.

If assumptions are **broken**, it can trigger a timeline extension or extra cost. Make sure the client understands this is standard for a **fixed-fee** arrangement.

---

## 7. Advantages of This Approach

- **Transparent Milestones**: The client sees clear deliverables for each phase.  
- **Clear Cost Boundaries**: You’ve locked in a total cost but baked in enough contingency to minimize your risk.  
- **Reduced Scope Creep**: Change orders are explicitly defined for major requests.  
- **Under Promise & Over Deliver**: By building in timeline/cost buffers, you can finish early or under budget, delighting your client.

## Final Contract Summary

1. **Scope**: Clearly outlined in the SOW with acceptance criteria for each deliverable.  
2. **Cost**: One total fixed price broken down by phases. Includes a 20% contingency.  
3. **Timeline**: 12–16 weeks, phased approach, each phase ~2–5 weeks.  
4. **Payment Terms**: 20/30/30/20 milestone structure (or a variation that suits your cash-flow needs).  
5. **Change Management**: Minor changes absorbed by the 20% contingency, major changes require a formal change order.  

By following this structure, you provide a **fixed-cost** contract that’s **transparent** for your client and **safe** for your team, ensuring both timely delivery and sufficient budget for any inevitable changes.
