# Project Phases & Deliverables

The project is grouped into four major phases. Each phase ends with delivery of key deliverables and includes a buffer for potential delays or scope revisions.

| **Phase**                                           | Duration      | Buffer  | **Key Deliverables**                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1**<br>*Discovery & Architecture*           | **3–5 weeks** | 1 week  | - Final requirements & validated scope<br>- Architecture diagrams (frontend, backend, AI, data pipelines)<br>- High-fidelity wireframes & design system<br>- Detailed project plan & risk assessment                                      |
| **Phase 2**<br>*Core MVP Implementation*            | **4–6 weeks** | 2 weeks | - User authentication & account management<br>- Basic AI chatbot (onboarding use case)<br>- Graph database & initial data ingestion<br>- User dashboard & notifications (initial version)                                                 |
| **Phase 3**<br>*Advanced AI & Specialized Features* | **4–6 weeks** | 2 weeks | - Matchmaking algorithms (co-founders, investors, researchers, enterprises)<br>- Investment & Research Commercialization Memo engines<br>- Recruitment portal with basic video AI<br>- Opportunity board & additional engagement features |
| **Phase 4**<br>*Testing, QA & Launch*               | **2–5 weeks** | 2 weeks | - Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, UAT)<br>- Final UI/UX polish<br>- Production deployment & monitoring<br>- Documentation & training<br>- Post-launch support plan                                                              |

**Overall Timeline**:  
- **Best-Case**: ~13 weeks total (+7 week buffer) 
- **Typical**: ~18 weeks (+7 week buffer) 
- **Worst-Case**: ~22 weeks (+7 week buffer) 

# Key Assumptions & Inclusions

1. **Timely Feedback**: Stakeholders will review deliverables and provide feedback promptly (within 2–3 business days).  
2. **Stable Core Requirements**: Major pivots or large new features will trigger discussions on scope and timeline adjustments.  
3. **Parallel Work**: Internally, we may run many tasks in parallel to optimize delivery, but the above timeline presents a safe end-to-end flow for external expectations.  
4. **3rd-Party Integrations**: Access to external APIs (e.g., LinkedIn, Google Scholar) must be readily available; delays or rate-limit issues may extend the timeline.

# Hours & Cost Estimates

**Base Hours**: ~1,550–1,600 hours (internal projection)  
**Contingency (20%)**: +320 hours
**Total Hours (with contingency)**: ~1,920 hours

**Hourly Rate Range**: \$80 – \$100/hour (blended)  
**Total Cost Range**: ~\$153,600 – \$192,000 (1,920 hours × \$80–\$100/hr)

> This range covers typical resource costs for the Project Manager, Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, and Data Scientist roles. Actual rates may vary based the team makeup.

## External Infrastructure Monthly Estimates

Here’s a **rough monthly range** (assuming moderate usage). We can get a more detailed estimate as part of Phase 1 of the project.

| **Cost Category**          | **Typical Monthly Range** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------:|
| **Compute & Hosting**      | \$375 – \$1,000          |
| **Database & Storage**     | \$370 – \$1,100          |
| **AI & ML Services**       | \$400 – \$1,700+         |
| **Third-Party Integrations** | \$50 – \$200+          |
| **Total Estimated Range**  | **\$1,195 – \$4,000+**   |

# Communication & Review Cadence

- **Phase Reviews**: At the end of each phase, we’ll present deliverables for stakeholder review and approval.  
- **Weekly/Bi-Weekly Check-Ins**: We’ll provide status reports highlighting work completed, upcoming tasks, and any potential risks.  
- **Change Management**: We’ll use some of the 20% contingency hours if minor scope adjustments are needed. Major changes will be handled as out-of-scope discussions.
