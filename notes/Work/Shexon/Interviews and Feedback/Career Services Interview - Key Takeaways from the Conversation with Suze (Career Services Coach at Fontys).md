1. **Career Development Is Not Linear—It’s Cyclical**
    
    - Suze uses a loop-based framework: a student periodically checks in (via a “quick scan”) to identify current needs, then selects the relevant module or activity.
    - The process isn’t a strict funnel from “exploration” to “secured job.” Instead, students revisit self-reflection and goal-setting at multiple points in their journey—even after they land a job.
        
2. **“Quick Scan” Approach vs. Tracking Progress**
    
    - Rather than showing a traditional progress bar (e.g., 30% complete), Suze’s method emphasizes continuous self-assessment.
    - Each time a student asks, “What do I need right now?” the quick scan steers them to the appropriate module (making choices, interview practice, etc.).
    - This shifts focus from a linear sense of “start-to-finish” to daily or situational needs.
        
3. **Emotional & Personal Factors Matter**
    
    - The emotional component (stress, fear of rejection, trial-and-error) is intrinsic to a student’s job search. Suze’s model accommodates these fluctuations by allowing them to cycle back into exploration, self-reflection, or skill-building as needed.
    - A purely metrics-based approach (e.g., counting job applications) may not capture a student’s internal progress or sense of readiness.
        
4. **Students Don’t Always Need a “Progress Visualization”**
    
    - Suze notes that most learners don’t require a formal progress tracker to feel they’re moving forward. They typically know when they’ve made personal strides—such as discovering new job options or clarifying their own preferences.
    - A highly visual “You are 50% done” might even be disheartening if the student still hasn’t achieved tangible results (e.g., a job).
        
5. **Non-Linear Navigation Between Modules**
    
    - Although Suze’s modules are labeled (1 through 4, etc.), students can jump to whichever module aligns with their current quick-scan outcome. They might skip some or revisit others multiple times.
    - This flexibility means a user might start in Module 3 (“Making Choices”), return to Module 2 (“Self-Knowledge”), then jump forward to Module 4 (“Practical Steps”).
        
6. **Fontys Career Services Emphasizes Self-Knowledge First**
    
    - Self-knowledge underpins decision-making around job searching, networking, and interview prep. Once students have clarified who they are and what they want, the “action steps” become more straightforward.
    - Suze described how the same reflective approach can be applied repeatedly—whether a student is uncertain about career direction or just refining details (like interview performance).
        
7. **Integration & Ease of Access**
    
    - Universities often use platforms like Canvas for all student-related activities. Adding a brand-new system or login can be a barrier.
    - Suze suggests that if you want widespread adoption, tying the new tool into existing systems (or at least offering seamless access) can help overcome user friction.
        
8. **Relevance to the Proposed Platform**
    
    - The cyclical view challenges the notion of a single “user journey” that starts at exploration and ends at job acceptance. Instead, the platform might guide students to the **right activity at the right time**, rather than trying to show a linear pipeline.
    - Emotional factors, reflection tools, and modular learning could be more impactful than a big progress bar or “X of X tasks completed.”
        
9. **No “One-Size-Fits-All”**
    
    - Students come in at different times, with different needs—some handle networking naturally but need CV help; others are stuck on career direction.
    - A flexible, module-based system that’s “always there” for quick scans or repeated check-ins can address these varied pathways.

**Overall Insight**  
Suze’s method suggests **an iterative, self-directed approach**:

- Students identify what they need today (through a quick check),
- Engage in the relevant module or resource,
- Repeat the cycle whenever their situation evolves.

For your platform, **emphasizing cyclical reflections and personalized modules**—rather than a strictly linear or numeric progress display—may more closely align with how real students experience career development.
