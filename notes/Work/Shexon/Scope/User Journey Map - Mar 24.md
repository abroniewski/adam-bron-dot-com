This **comprehensive user journey map** is organised into two parts:

1. **Progressive (Stage-Based) Steps** – The logical flow a user follows as they move from “I’m exploring careers” to “I’ve accepted an offer." The user typically traverses these 7 steps in sequence—though they might revisit “Skill Building” if an interview highlights a gap, or redo “Applying” if rejections pile up.
2. **Overarching (Cross-Cutting) Elements** – Themes that affect every step of the process, such as emotional support, language awareness, and visa clarity.
