**Date:** March 5 2025
**Participants:** Adam Broniewski, Ava Mohammadi, Navid Mohamadi
**Purpose:** Meet-and-greet to explore collaboration on building a demo for Shexon

---

## **Background Information**

- **Ava** is finishing her **Master’s in Data Science and AI**, with a strong focus on **machine learning and AI development**. While she has built **ML APIs**, she has not yet developed a **full web service or app from start to finish**.
- **Adam** completed the **same Master’s program**, with experience in **building and hosting products and software**. However, his background is **bootstrapped**, as he does not have a formal **computer science degree** prior to his master’s.
- They both see this as a **great collaboration opportunity**, combining Ava’s **AI expertise** with Adam’s **experience in product development and deployment**.

## **Key Discussion Points**

### **1. Purpose of the Demo**

- The demo is intended for **presale discussions with universities** to help secure funding for the product build.
- The goal is to develop a prototype that can later be **replicated and customised for other universities**.
- **Timeline:** The target is to have a something in place for feedback by **March 17, 2025**.

### **2. Scope of the Demo**

- The demo will function as an **interactive API** that can integrate as part of the overall Shexon platform.
- It should not be just functional but **polished and visually presentable**, as per Navid’s request.
- **Core functionality:**
    1. A student interacts with an **AI-powered assistant** to receive answers and guidance.
    2. The assistant connects the student with **relevant career developers**.
    3. The system recommends **resources such as workshops and job opportunities**.
    4. The university will provide **role descriptions, internship course details, and other reference materials** to tailor the demo.

### **3. Technical Considerations**

- **API development is crucial**, allowing for potential integration with external services in the future.
- **Adding external service integrations within two weeks is unrealistic**—a minimum of four weeks is needed.
- The demo will showcase Shexon's capabilities, with a focus on **time savings for students and career developers**.
- A key question remains: **What specific KPIs will measure the demo's success?**

## **Decisions Made**

- **Initial development focus:** A **wireframe and technical roadmap** will be created before development starts.
- **Data request from the university** is necessary for accurate role descriptions and course details.
- **Ava is responsible for drafting the use case workflow** for a student seeking career support.
- **Navid will review Ava’s proposal** to ensure alignment with expectations.

## **Action Items & Next Steps**

### **1. Immediate Tasks**

✅ Ava to draft a **use case workflow** mapping a student’s journey through the AI assistant.  
✅ Ava to **draft a proposal** for Navid outlining the demo’s objectives and structure.  
✅ Adam and Ava to meet on **Friday, March 7, 2025, at 11 AM at TU/e** to kick off the project.

### **2. Development Roadmap**

1. **Build a wireframe** based on the use case.
2. **Draft a technical roadmap** outlining development steps.
3. **Begin building the demo** once the roadmap is finalized.

### **3. Legal & Administrative**

- **NDAs and agreements** are forthcoming and need to be finalized before development proceeds.

## **Outstanding Questions**

❓ **What specific KPIs** will measure the success of the demo?  
❓ **What additional data requests** (besides role descriptions and internships) should be made to the university?
