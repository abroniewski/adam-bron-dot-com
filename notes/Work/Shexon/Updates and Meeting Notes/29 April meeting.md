- busy with event
- Rabo bank wants long term colab, pushing them to deny deals with other (€3k in funding for catering)
- partnership starting with legal company. has already pitched that we have a platform that can redirect people, they seem interested. 
	- 2 types of customers -> private and corporate
	- meet at event, and then have a call with them together to get more info about common questions
- challenge -> how can we distinguish from ChatGPT?
	- legal information training
- has contact with 3 people jrs interested in developing platform
	- backend, frontend, complimentary skills
- holding off on intro with Quincy as collaboration is still not certain
	- vision for platform and what is needed differs. Navid believes in having not just the AI tool, but an ecosystem that includes mentorship, partner organisations, events, etc.
- student journey is non-linear
	- need to rework the business logic of the journey/activities to better represent activities
- Navid wants a website showcasing what the tool can do
	- the website should be considered a "feature" of the platform and integrated into the whole right away instead of treated as a seperate element.
	
NEXT STEPS
