Navid is focused on **retention of international talent**, particularly recent graduates. The key challenge is that international graduates are leaving, while the government is limiting new talent onboarding from outside the country. Universities need to demonstrate **high retention rates** to justify funding, and companies want to improve **diversity and inclusion** beyond hiring only Dutch employees.

#### **Key Stakeholders & Insights:**

1. **Bi-cultural international new grads** – The primary group at risk of leaving.
2. **Government** – Looking to **reduce reliance on foreign talent** while making better use of those already in the country.
3. **Universities** – Need to **showcase retention success** to secure future funding.
4. **Companies** – Interested in **diversity and inclusion** but require **clear value** to invest in solutions.

Navid has a **graduate working on a demo** for this initiative. She has been engaged for 2-3 months, initially developing a **mentorship program** but is now shifting towards **AI-driven solutions**. She wants to act as the **Product Owner** for this project.

### **Next Steps:**

- **Navid plans to meet with key stakeholders** in the next two weeks to understand their needs and potential contributions.
- **Adam will follow up in two weeks** to assess the opportunity for collaboration.
- Adam expressed interest in **pushing his skills in rapid demo development** and aligning efforts with Navid’s initiative.

### **Upcoming Event:**

- **May 22nd (Evening)** – Next networking event related to this topic.
