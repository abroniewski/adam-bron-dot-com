Agenda
1. Review and align on SOW
	1. **Student Career Path**
		1. updated + review with Shexon members
		2. finalize this and Navid will be happy, because this really drives the development
	2. Are you happy with what you've seen?
		1. Yes, but sometimes there is doubt about what it is we want people to experience.
		2. Very happy with recordings with talk over
		3. Profile feature is a like
		4. Giving a character/feeling to the bot sounds interesting (need to be careful with what kind of image is used)
2. Support requests for development
	1. **Visa knowledge base**
		1. Expat centre uses "partners" that provide advice and workshops.
		2. Collaboration with partners makes it possible for us to send people to
		3. What we can do is look only at government platforms or .gov websites talking about 
			1. Best first start for demo -> pull together a reference guide based off of online resources (no interview). Navid will follow up in 1 week (March 26th)
	2. Interview Prep Knowledge Base
		1. Quincy might be able to help. Postpone until after I talk with Quincy. He is from Career Heros
		2. Meet with Qunicy after the other 1 on 1 group members. Navid will attend.
3. Wants finalized version of map
4. NO need for demo/feature development timeline.
