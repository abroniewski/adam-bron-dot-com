## Guidance for Future Estimates
- For LLM/AI-assisted solo work, use **0.75–1 hour per commit** as a baseline for feature-level tasks.
- For multi-feature days, expect **4–5 hours of productive output**.
- Major features (e.g., onboarding, backend integration) are typically delivered in **1–5 hour bursts**.
- Ignore gpt-engineer-app[bot] commits for velocity and performance analysis—only use Adam Broniewski's commits and time tracking.

## Notes
- Time tracking includes planning, research, and meetings; commit timestamps reflect only coding work.
- Use this data to estimate future features by mapping planned commits to expected hours, adjusting for complexity.
