# From Liz

I want to send you my feedback directly, as well as having Renske collect comments from the rest of the team today.

Overall, it looks WAAAAY better than the original version, much more modern and suitable for any device. Is there duplication for the non-show events, like workshops being on both the shows page and the academy page? Or are those just links on the shows page, taking viewers to the academy page for full details? I see some very good marketing effort in the demo too, three word tag lines are great 😉

How do you envision sign-up events, like a call for auditions or a sign-up for workshops? Would that appear on the front page, or would viewers find it on the “shows” or “academy” page?

I guess the most important thing for Renske / marketing people, how do they introduce a new “upcoming show”, and move the old “upcoming” to a “past event”. Is that fairly straightforward?

# From Renske
 - Easy and logical to identify where to find specific information.
 - Tagline is fantastic
 - Some more visual images/video on the homepage would be be great
 - Colour palette: a few different opinions. It stands out, that's for sure. Geert would like to see a lighter version to compare it with the current one. Liz would like to keep the current colour palette for the mobile phone version of the site (if that doesn't negatively affect the mobile data one needs to open the website on their phone... Don't know if that's a valid concern, but I leave that up to you).
 - Not all titles of text boxes are aligned in the same way. Preferences to have them all centered.
