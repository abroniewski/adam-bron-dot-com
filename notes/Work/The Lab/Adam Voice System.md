# Adam Voice System

## Objective
Build a reusable writing system that sounds like Adam across channels without slipping into generic AI copy.

## How it works
1. Ingest historical writing with strong human provenance.
2. Prioritise samples older than two years.
3. Build style corpus and channel playbooks.
4. Generate channel-specific drafts.
5. Compare assistant draft vs Adam final edit.
6. Update rules from recurring edit deltas.

## Current status
- Source manifest complete.
- 24-sample extraction pass complete.
- LinkedIn + Email playbook v1 complete.
- Next phase: iterative draft cycles and v2 refinement.
