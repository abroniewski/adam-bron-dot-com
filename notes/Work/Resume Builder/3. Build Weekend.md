Can you please take a look at this technical roadmap as well as the accompanying step-by-step implementation plan to see if we are still implementing the core technical aspect of a guided LLM assistant with backend validated progression?Objectives/Deliverables:
1. logic design approach using DB + LLM + business logic
2. working implementation with no UI that shows I can take in info and influence logic.


What I'm building:
A **goal-state LLM orchestration engine**: **a modular, guided LLM assistant** with backend-validated progression

**schema-driven, modular AI assistant** where each user interaction is guided by backend-defined steps, validated by stored context, and powered by LLM prompting

Process Steps
1. build a MASTER CONTEXT of the users experience, work history, achievements, quantifiable metrics, and anything else that can be used as an input (ELEMENTS) for a RESUME or COVER LETTER regardless of what this specific job is that they're applying for.
2. Analyze the job role description (JOB ROLE INFO) to pull out the specific skills that are required to be a highly qualified candidate for the role, all of these skills and experience and industry practices will be pulled out without regard for the user who's applying to the rank and what their background is, but just being pulled out objectively.
3. Lookup info on the company (COMPANY INFO) the user is applying for (company website + news articles + blog posts) To gather context about the company itself that will help to make the resume and the cover letter targeted for the company by understanding the company's values, work culture, and the things that they're doing and using this as a context that we'll later use to draw out specific user experiences.
4. Based on the JOB ROLE INFO and COMPANY INFO, identify the information from the MASTER CONTEXT that can be used to form the RESUME and COVER LETTER. 
5. For all user information that we've identified, see if there are some more details or descriptions that we can have the user provide to either clarify or expand on or improve the context being used. look to quantify anything that can possibly be quantified. Use the information from the MASTER CONTEXT to think outside the box and ask the user if there are any other experiences, achievements, or things that they've done that they haven't shared yet but are likely to have done based on what we're seeing in their MASTER CONTEXT. But maybe they just forgot to document it or share it with us. Update the MASTER CONTEXT with any new ELEMENTS that were previously missing.
6. Build an initial outline of the RESUME and COVER LETTER, focusing on which of the ELEMENTS from the MASTER CONTEXT will be highlighted in each.
7. Show the outline to the user, and provide an explanation of what ELEMENTS are being included in the RESUME, and which are in the COVER LETTER.
8. Prompt the user for any additional personal ties/aspects/stories/experiences (ELEMENTS) that they can connect with on the values side of the company based on their values/news/blog posts. Update the MASTER CONTEXT with any new ELEMENTS that were previously missing.
9. With the new user input, generate a RESUME and COVER LETTER using predefines TEMPLATES. Also, save this new user input to their “master context”. 
10. Have user review for factual correctness of the RESUME and ask for any changes they might want for the tone or style of the COVER LETTER.
11. export the COVER LETTER and RESUME as a downloadable application package in PDF (CV + cover letter).
