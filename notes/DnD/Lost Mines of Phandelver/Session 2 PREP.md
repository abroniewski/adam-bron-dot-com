# 🛠 Lazy DM Prep – **Session 2: "The Goblin Truth"**

---

## ✅ 1. **Review the Characters**

### 🧝 Viva

- Stealthy, agile, clever.
    
- Climbs everything. Loves sneaking, traps, tricks.
    
- Already found the prisoner (Sildar) solo.
    

### 🪓 Grog

- Strong, silly, brave. Built “giant feet.”
    
- Loves talking, testing food, and friendly threats.
    
- Currently sitting by the goblin campfire.
    

🎯 **DM Notes**:  
They lean into clever problem-solving over combat. Keep rewarding creative thinking, bluffing, traps, stealth, and dialogue.

---

## 💥 2. **Create a Strong Start**

> **Opening line**:  
> “Last time, Viva snuck through a hidden crack and found a prisoner tied up in a dark chamber. Meanwhile, Grog was eating stew with the goblin leader, just hearing whispers about a prisoner. One wrong word… and this peaceful scene could explode.”

### Options for immediate action:

- Viva talks to Sildar quietly.
    
- Grog presses the goblins for more info or starts getting suspicious.
    
- Tension rises if goblins notice someone else is in the cave.
    

🎯 Start with **split tension**, then converge the party.

---

## 🎬 3. **Outline Potential Scenes**

Use 1–2 scenes per hour.

1. **Viva frees or speaks to Sildar**
    
    - Info dump: Gundren taken to **Cragmaw Castle**, map to **Wave Echo Cave**, missing contact in Phandalin.
        
2. **Grog keeps goblins calm (or not)**
    
    - Goblins may grow suspicious of "giant-foot man".
        
    - Optional: internal goblin squabble.
        
3. **Reconvene & Escape**
    
    - Sneak out together… or goblins realize there are two intruders.
        
4. **Klarg Teased (but not encountered)**
    
    - Goblins drop Klarg’s name in fear or panic.
        
    - Maybe see Klarg’s room but no direct encounter.
        
5. **Return to Wagon & Head to Phandalin**
    
    - Sildar pays them and urges travel to town.
        
    - Seeds next arc.

## 🕵️ 4. **Secrets and Clues** (Drop Anywhere)

Use these like “puzzle pieces” to reveal the bigger story:

1. Gundren and Sildar were riding **ahead** of the players.
    
2. **Gundren was taken to Cragmaw Castle**.
    
3. He carried a **map to Wave Echo Cave**.
    
4. Wave Echo Cave is a **legendary lost mine of magic and wealth**.
    
5. Gundren has two brothers also searching for the cave.
    
6. The **Cragmaw goblins** work for someone called **King Grol**.
    
7. Klarg is the bugbear in charge of this cave, but **fears King Grol**.
    
8. Sildar is a member of the **Lords’ Alliance**, here to find **Iarno Albrek**.
    
9. The town of **Phandalin** is struggling with troublemakers (Redbrands).
    
10. Gundren hoped reopening the mine would **revive Phandalin’s economy**.

## 🌍 5. **Fantastic Locations**

### 🕳 Goblin Prison Chamber (Viva’s location)

- Cramped, root-covered walls
    
- Rusted chains and scraps of armor
    
- Stale water dripping into a bowl
    

### 🔥 Goblin Campfire Room (Grog’s location)

- Smoky, sour stew boiling
    
- Moss-covered rock “throne”
    
- Carved crude goblin totems watching from shadows
    

### 🐺 Klarg’s Den (Foreshadow only)

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 6. **Important NPCs**

|Name|Role|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Sildar Hallwinter**|Prisoner, quest-giver|Polite, firm. Gives major plot hooks. Injured but alive.|
|**Unnamed Goblin Leader**|Grog’s stew buddy|Nervous. Mid-rank. Doesn’t want Klarg to find out about the guests.|
|**Klarg** (Mentioned only)|Big bad bugbear|“The one who doesn’t forgive mistakes.” No face-to-face yet.|
|**Gundren Rockseeker**|Captured dwarf|Not seen this session. Needs to be rescued later.|
|**King Grol** (Rumored)|Goblin king at Cragmaw Castle|Might be behind Gundren’s capture. Mentioned by Sildar.|

---

## 🧟 7. **Relevant Monsters**

They probably won’t fight this session unless things go sideways. But prep light stats for:

- **2–4 goblins** (if betrayal or alarm)
    
- **Goblin boss** (if your stew friend loses patience)
    
- **Klarg (bugbear)** – just tease, don’t reveal
    
- **Ripper (wolf)** – maybe see tracks/scratches or hear growling
    

📌 _Tone: Let them win socially, but know danger exists._

---

## 🧤 8. **Magic Item Rewards**

Sildar might offer a **small reward** for his rescue, or promise payment in Phandalin.

Optional loot:

- **Potion of Healing** (found in Klarg’s den if they sneak there)
    
- **Wand of Prestidigitation** (fun utility for Viva, if they find it)
    
- **Giant Toe Ring** (mundane item Grog believes makes him stronger)
    

🎯 Keep it light and flavorful, fit their style.
