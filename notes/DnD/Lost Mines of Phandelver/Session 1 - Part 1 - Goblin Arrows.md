# Session 1 Story Notes (Correct Order)

## Quick recap

Grog and Viva were escorting a wagon of supplies toward Phandalin when they found two dead horses blocking the road with arrows nearby . They heard movement in the trees and chose to investigate carefully.

## Scene-by-scene story

### 1) The roadblock

- Morning forest road, wagon pulled by two oxen.
    
- Two dead horses across the road, arrows around them, and a rustling in the trees. You asked what they do.
    

### 2) Secure the wagon, then recon

- They decide on a “covert reconnaissance mission.”
    
- They nail/secure the wagon and keep the oxen from running. You also warned that sharpening the axe would take time.
    

### 3) Climb and stealth through the trees

- DC10 climbing check. Viva cracks a branch, but nobody notices.
    
- Team stealth check DC10 to move quietly. You describe using wind and sliding feet to avoid crunchy leaves.
    

### 4) Identify the goblins

- Viva rolls Investigation (19), Grog rolls Survival (4).
    
- Grog sees goblins but is unsure how many; Viva clearly spots three goblins, nervous, with one tapping a hollow log.
    

### 5) Friendly approach and questioning

- They choose to walk up calmly and talk.
    
- Goblins argue about “watching the road.”
    
- Grog/Viva ask about the horses; goblins play dumb at first, then admit the horses were “loud and fast” and they were told to stop wagons.
    

### 6) Negotiation: magical coins and the zipline trick

- Goblins want something “valuable.”
    
- The kids decide to claim the coins are magic.
    
- Goblin demands proof. Viva stalls for time while they plan.
    
- They create a “magical zipline” moment: Grog throws an axe tied to a rope at a tree as Viva does an “incantation,” and the goblins buy it. Deal made.
    

### 7) Goblins guide them to Cragmaw Hideout entrance

- Goblins lead them along a narrow forest path to a hidden cave with running water.
    
- Goblins leave them about 10 metres from the entrance and return to the road.
    

### 8) Grog’s stilt-boots (giant feet)

- Before entering, Grog crafts blocks of wood tied to his feet with vines, mud camouflage, and carved “toes” to look bigger.
    
- This becomes a signature visual for him.
    

### 9) Entering the cave: trap spotted, Viva on the ceiling

- At the entrance, Grog rolls Perception (10) and spots a simple rope loop trap, steps around it.
    
- Viva rolls Stealth (18), climbs smoothly, and moves along stalactites above Grog.
    

### 10) Meeting the leader: calm but ready

- Inside: goblins stop chewing, stare. Leader calls Grog “very confident” and you prompt for intimidation/persuasion/performance.
    
- Grog’s intent is to chill things out but stay ready (hand on rope/weapon access). Viva’s intent is protection from above.
    

### 11) Horses explanation, verified

- Grog asks about the horses.
    
- Leader says horses belonged to loud men, guards panicked, “panicking guards do stupid things.”
    
- Kids roll Insight and you confirm the leader is embarrassed and truthful.
    

### 12) Food test and “story time”

- Leader invites Grog to sit by the fire with stew and bread.
    
- Grog secretly tests food for poison using a cockroach vial, rolling stealth with advantage because it’s dark. Food is safe.
    

### 13) The real hook appears: prisoner

- While Grog listens, he hears goblins whispering about a prisoner they just caught.
    

### 14) Viva scouts deeper: secret crack, trap, prisoner discovered

- Viva decides to explore for traps and alternate routes.
    
- She stealths away; Grog fails to notice her leaving and believes she is still above him.
    
- Viva finds a smoother worn section of wall and a narrow crack hidden by a root.
    
- Investigation with advantage reveals a boulder trap; she jams it with a stick.
    
- She squeezes through and finds a small chamber with a tied-up human warrior, bruised and beaten.
    

### 15) End state

- Grog is seated with the leader, believes things are calm, and has heard about a prisoner.
    
- Viva is alone in a side chamber, staring at the prisoner.
    

That’s the correct end snapshot.

# The Next Hook (Clean restart for Session 2)

## Opening line to read

“Last time, Grog was eating stew with the goblin leader, hearing the truth about the horses… and hearing whispers about a prisoner. Meanwhile Viva slipped away through a hidden crack in the cave wall, stopped a boulder trap, and found the prisoner tied up in a small chamber.”

## Immediate decision point

You start Session 2 with Viva holding the spotlight:

Viva choices:

- Free the prisoner quietly.
    
- Sneak back to warn Grog first.
    
- Observe and learn who the prisoner is.
    

Grog situation:

- He is in a negotiation-friendly space, but does not know Viva moved.
    
- He knows there is a prisoner, but not where.
    

That split tension is your engine for the next session.

If you want, I can also give you a “Session 2 opener” that cleanly re-centres both kids and gives each one a heroic first move in the first five minutes.
