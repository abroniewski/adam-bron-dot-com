## **Crystalline Chamber and the Construct**

- The party encountered a **crystalline scorpion** and its smaller crystal offspring.
- A mysterious voice from the crystal construct halted the encounter:
    - "You have been deemed worthy but lack focus. Be the change you want to see."
    - The chamber vanished, leaving the party in a **white void**.

## **Arrival in Icewind Dale**

- The construct infused the party with knowledge about **[[Auril]], the Frostmaiden**, and **Icewind Dale’s perpetual winter**:
    - The region has been plagued by **darkness and cold for two years**.
    - The [[Ten-Towns]] make sacrifices to [[Auril]], but they have not lifted her curse.
- Each party member received **winter gear** and a **map of Icewind Dale**.
- Using the map, the party determined they were nearest to [[Dougan’s Hole]] and traveled there to avoid freezing.

## **Arrival in [[Dougan’s Hole]]**

- The party used **creative methods** to stay warm:
    
    - [[Sam]] crafted a makeshift torch using scraps from his books.
    - [[Emerald]] lent Smokey, her squirrel companion, to [[Sam]] for warmth.
- They were greeted by [[Danika]], who took them to the tavern and introduced several key topics:
    
    - [[Chwinga]]: Small, elemental beings that may be amplifying Icewind Dale's magical winter.
    - [[Danika]] asked the party to help study the [[Chwinga]] and gave them a **Lantern of Tracking**, which glows green when near elemental magic.
    - [[Danika]] revealed **human sacrifices to [[Auril]]** occur in larger towns like [[Bryn Shander]], [[Easthaven]], and [[Targos]].
        - These sacrifices happen on the **Night of the New Moon**, 15 days away.
        - The sacrifices seem **rigged**, favoring outsiders over locals.
    - [[Danika]] mentioned the **City of [[Ythryn]]**, a mythical Netherese city buried beneath a glacier.
        - [[Ythryn]] could hold powerful secrets that could change the fate of Icewind Dale.
