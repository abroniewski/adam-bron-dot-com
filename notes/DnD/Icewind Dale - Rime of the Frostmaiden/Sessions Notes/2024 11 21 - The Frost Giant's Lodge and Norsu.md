## **Inside the [[Frost Giant’s Lodge|Lodge]]**

- **The group hesitates to enter** due to [[Kai]]'s Vision of [[Sam]] surrounded by wolves and fire in a castle.
- **[[Emerald]]** attempts to reassure [[Sam]], jokingly calling him a “postmortem hero,” while [[Myra]] uses guilt ("What about the kids?!") to motivate him to continue.
- The wolves recommend the **middle entrance**, which the group follows.
- **[[Kai]]'s reckless behavior**:
    - [[Kai]] shouts "ECHO ECHO," drawing attention.
    - A voice responds, “Who goes there?”
    - [[Myra]] casts a **sphere of silence** in the area where the voice echoed, muting sound.
- **The party encounters a woolly mammoth named [[Norsu]]**, [[Garagai]]’s companion:
    - [[Norsu]] initially rushes past the group but returns later during combat.
    - The throne room has a **giant icy throne** with a rune meaning "ICE" etched into it.
    - [[Emerald]] suggests destroying the throne, but [[Kai]], fearing [[Sam]]’s vision, scratches the rune instead, experiencing the **essence of pure cold**.

## **Combat with [[Norsu]]**

- **[[Norsu]]’s Story**:
    - [[Norsu]] reveals that [[Garagai]] was killed by **adventurers who stole his sword and pillaged the lodge**.
    - The wolves have been kidnapping children to feed [[Norsu]], trying to keep him alive.
