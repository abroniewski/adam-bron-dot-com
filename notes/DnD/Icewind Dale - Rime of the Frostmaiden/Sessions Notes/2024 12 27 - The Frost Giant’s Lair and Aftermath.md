## **Exploring the [[Frost Giant’s Lodge]]**

- The party discovers **two rooms**:
    - **Furnished Bedroom**: Musty but intact, likely used by [[Garagai]].
    - **Tunnel Room**: A central tunnel leads into the dark, with **[[Thrym]] secretion** (a substance secreted before a **[[Remorhaz]] gives birth**) coating the walls.
        - **[[Emerald]]** collects some of the secretion for later use, showcasing her knowledge of animals.
- **[[Emerald]]’s squirrel companion Smokey** scouts the area but takes longer than expected to return, causing her visible worry.

### **The Icy Wall and Crying Children**

- **Crying sounds** lead the party to a large icy wall.
    
    - [[Kai]] finds barrels of whale oil and attempts to move them outside, but spills some due to a loose lid. The group clears the room before **[[Sam]]’s Firebolt** melts a hole in the wall.
    - **[[Myra]] finishes shattering the weakened wall** with her magic, allowing the group to enter.
- Inside, they find **[[Jack]] and [[Jill]]**, two children trapped in a cage.
    
    - **[[Emerald]]’s vines bend the bars**, freeing the children.
    - The children are warmed with makeshift torches, revealing slightly unusual features (possibly the result of inbreeding).

## **Searching the Lair**

- **Whale Oil Cache**: The party learns from the children that the barrels of whale oil are extremely valuable.
    
- **Whale Carcass**: [[Emerald]] carves out the **whale’s eye**, potentially for use as a spell component or trophy.
    
- **Frozen Chest**: [[Kai]] suggests melting it with fire, but the group opts for a more cautious approach using torches.
    
- **Kobold Encounter**:
    
    - [[Kai]] finds a **[[Chwinga]] figurine** under the dining table and throws it to [[Sam]].
    - A **lizard tail** spotted behind a chair leads to the discovery of three kobolds: **[[Zilbo]], [[Snorb]], and [[Holgy]]**, who are looting the lair.
    - [[Kai]] insults and even slaps one kobold, escalating tensions.
        - **[[Kai]] throws a dagger but misses**. The kobolds leave angrily after threatening the group.
        - The rest of the group reprimands [[Kai]], causing visible tension between him and [[Sam]].

## **Returning to [[Dougan’s Hole]]**

- The group returns Jack and Jill to their home, where they are tearfully reunited with **[[Hilda]]** (a relative of ambiguous relation, potentially mother, aunt, or both).
    - As thanks, Hilda gives [[Kai]] a pair of **magical winter boots**.
    - Tension between [[Kai]] and [[Sam]] peaks as the group prepares to rest for the night:
        - [[Kai]] refuses to share a room with [[Sam]], storming off.
        - [[Sam]], upset by [[Kai]]’s recklessness, begins to question his leadership.

## **Character Moments at the Inn**

### **[[Sam]] and [[Kai]]’s Confrontation**

- In private, [[Kai]] confesses a desire to protect someone, hinting at deeper motivations.
    - [[Sam]] realizes [[Kai]] is talking about him but lashes out, referencing the **incident at Strixhaven** that got [[Kai]] expelled.
    - [[Kai]], visibly hurt, promises to change. [[Sam]] regrets his words but leaves without reconciliation, burdened by their unresolved tension.

### **[[Sam]] and [[Myra]]'s Planning**

- [[Sam]] and [[Myra]] discuss **the glacier and [[Ythryn]]**, spinning it as a goal tied to [[Myra]]’s quest but clearly motivated by [[Sam]]’s desire to recover the magic for **Strixhaven** and his personal redemption.
- [[Myra]] mentions seeing [[Kai]] cry, urging [[Sam]] to approach him, showing the growing bond between party members.

---

## **Innkeeper’s Request**

- The innkeeper of Dougan’s Hole asks for help:
    - A **shipment of mead from [[Good Mead]]** has gone missing.
    - He offers a **sled and dogs** to investigate and help the party reach [[Kelvin’s Cairn]] faster.
    - Warns of strange phenomena: **herbivores turning predatory** and animals acting unnaturally.

---

## **Hooks for Future Sessions**

### **1. Tension Between [[Kai]] and [[Sam]]**

- Continue exploring the unresolved tension between [[Kai]]’s recklessness and [[Sam]]’s drive for control and responsibility.
- [[Sam]]’s regret for his harsh words may lead to future attempts at reconciliation.

### **2. [[Good Mead]] Missing Shipment**

- Investigate the missing mead, connecting it to future encounters in **Good Mead** and its election subplot.

### **3. [[Kelvin’s Cairn]] and the Glacier**

- The innkeeper’s mention of **dwarves near Kelvin’s Cairn** ties into the group’s goal of learning more about [[Ythryn]].
- Use the encounter to explore ancient Netherese lore and build anticipation for the lost city.

### **4. [[Emerald]]’s Animal Knowledge**

- The **[[Thrym]] secretion** and [[Emerald]]’s fascination with animals (and Smokey’s role) could lead to new discoveries, especially related to a **[[Remorhaz]] encounter**.

### **5. Animal Behavior and [[Auril]]’s Influence**

- The unnatural behavior of animals could be tied to **[[Auril]]’s frost druids** or **corruption from [[Chardalyn]]**.

### **6. Unfinished Kobold Business**

- The kobolds Zilbo, Snorb, and Holgy may return seeking revenge or redemption, potentially leading to a humorous or tense encounter.
