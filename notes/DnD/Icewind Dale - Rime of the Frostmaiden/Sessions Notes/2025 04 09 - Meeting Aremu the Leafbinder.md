crew probably wants to go to 
- Vaelish Gant is in a prison at Revel's End
- Chardalyn can be found in the mines of Termalaine

the crew wants to go Termalaine and check out the mine, get some ax beaks + dog sleads, head north to [[Revels End]] to talk to [[Vaelish Gant]] about infusing Chardalyn, and then go to Kelvin's Cairn to look at Ythryn's tower.

RECAP
morning time
Smokey -> unfinished business. white patch of fur is new since his transformation.
Sam and Kai exit from same bedroom
Sam doesn't remember what happened last night, Kai does
Harry "the Vulgar" Berry Bush leaves the group

Chardalyn saved everyone. Emerald didn't tell anyone that she made a deal with a deity to let everyone live.
Emerald turned on by Sam after Sam shows his disappointment
Pick ax from cave. Had symbols. Symbols are in Fey Dark and remind Myra about the stuff that happened to her. She tells the group about Lorrain

The group tells Olivessa Untapour everything that happened.

The crew goes to meet with Aremu the "Leafbinder".

Emerald hears about Aremu's story and feels like 
The clan told Emerald not to come back until she can prove she has changed.

Aremu give snow capped lotus and frost.

Tells everyone where they can find [[Revels End]]

**The plan moving forward is:**
6 days until next full moon
Termaline to investigate mines to find Chardalyn, then North to Revel's End via (to meet with the guy from Arcane Brotherhood), and potentially Kelvin's Carin (Ytheryn sunken city for magic)

# **CAMPAIGN OBJECTIVES**
Find and study Auril the Frostmaiden
Have **not** yet convinced the town to feed Norsu

Vaelish Gant might have information on how to harness or infuse chardalyn, and he might know more information about Ytheryn. -> How does Sam use Chardalyn? Help Myra get her family back by using the Chardalyn, or get the Chardalyn for his personal gains.

Kai's character is saw a scepter and needs to break it using Chardalyn. Following Sam around because doesn't really know how. Wants to becaume powerful without needing to use magic. But doesn't want to use big magic, cause last time that happened, Kai's brother died. Looking to protect Sam as a proxy for her brother.
