## **Leaving the Vault**

- The group emerges from the **[[Vault of the Desolate Spyres]]** and is joined by reinforcements:
    
    - **[[Oskar Durthane]]**: An elderly dwarf, seeking one last quest after losing his adventuring partner.
    - **[[Alex]]**: A taciturn warlock with cryptic knowledge of the crystalline creatures.
    - **[[Emerald]]**: A Witherbloom druid from [[Strixhaven]], known for her carefree attitude and her squirrel companion, **[[Smokey]]**.
- **Tension arises among the group**:
    
    - [[Kai|Kaiden]] steals [[Sam]]’s report card, but Alex retrieves and returns it, showing unexpected reliability.
    - Alex mentions that the crystalline scorpions are tied to **ancient memories** but teleports away without explanation, leaving the group wondering about his true motives.

## **Effects of the Crystal Fragments**

- Each character interacts with their **crystal fragment**, experiencing unique effects:
    - **[[Sam]]**: His fragment turns his skin to marble when touched and amplifies memories of his parents’ death at the hands of a fire djinn, deepening his resolve to master magic and protect those around him.
    - **Other characters** also show signs of having personal and emotional interactions with their fragments, though the specific details remain unspoken.

## **Arrival at the [[Crystalline Chamber]]**

- The chamber is a vast room with **panels and beams of light** refracting from a hole in the ceiling. The light creates a puzzle that must be solved to progress.

### **Exploring the Chamber**

- **Recklessness**:
    
    - Oskar pushes [[Kai|Kaiden]] into the room without hesitation, risking triggering a trap.
    - [[Sam]] uses his **unseen servant Ifrit** to carefully examine the panels without setting off any mechanisms.
- **The Puzzle**:
    
    - **[[Myra]] and [[Kai|Kaiden]]** begin moving panels to direct beams of light onto the chamber’s crystals.
    - The light reveals **patterns on the floor**: an image of a **sandworm** and a **scorpion**.
    - Moving the panels into the correct position completes the image.
- **Complications**:
    
    - The door to the chamber begins to close as the puzzle progresses.
    - **[[Emerald]]** summons druidic vines to hold the door open, showcasing quick thinking but immediately stops to smoke a joint, frustrating the group.

## **The Statue and the Mechanism**

- Once the puzzle is completed, a **statue of a scale** appears at the edge of the room.
    
    - [[Emerald]] attempts to balance the scale, aided by Oskar.
    - Smokey hops onto the scale, triggering a new mechanism.
- **The Trap is Sprung**:
    
    - A hole in the floor opens, and a **massive crystalline scorpion**—larger than any they’ve seen before—rises from the ground, ready to attack.

## **Hooks for Future Sessions**

1. **The Crystalline Scorpion**:
    
    - How will the party handle this new, much larger crystalline foe?
    - Could the scorpion’s connection to memories and the cataclysm reveal new insights?
2. **Alex’s Whereabouts**:
    
    - Where has Alex gone, and what is he doing? His knowledge of the scorpions hints at deeper secrets yet to be revealed.
3. **[[Emerald]]’s Role**:
    
    - Explore [[Emerald]]’s surprising mix of insight (balancing the scale) and distractions (smoking). How does she balance her carefree attitude with her growing responsibilities?
4. **The Crystal Fragments**:
    
    - What deeper effects might the fragments have on the party over time? Could they offer insight into the cataclysm or create new risks?
5. **Oskar’s Guidance**:
    
    - The dwarf’s knowledge and guidance have proven useful so far. Will his age or past experiences provide further aid—or challenges?
