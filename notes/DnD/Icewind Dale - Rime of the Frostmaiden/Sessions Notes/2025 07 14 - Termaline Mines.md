# Secrets and Clues

- "I keep telling everyone the Everlasting Rime isn't the Frostmaiden's doing. It's actually the Arcane Brotherhood, plotting another takeover of Ten-Towns! A wizard who was burned at the stake in Easthaven admitted to being one of them, and he said there are other Arcane Brotherhood wizards lurking among us. Vaelish Gant is behind it all, no doubt. The scoundrel is locked away in Revel's End, but that doesn't make him any less dangerous. Someone should find out what he knows!" (See "[Revel's End](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#idrotf,12,revel's%20end,0)")
- **Centuries ago**, Termalaine was built atop the ruins of an **ancient outpost** established by an elemental-worshiping sect of Netherese arcanists. These arcanists believed the **Elemental Planes** were sources of ultimate magical truth and power.
- The **jinn carvings** are remnants of this cult’s reverence for **powerful elemental entities**, particularly **efreeti** (fire jinn), whom they hoped to bargain with — or bind — to serve as magical patrons.
- When the bonds of magic broke during the fall of the Netherese empire, the **djinn was released**, vengeful and free to burn its way across Faerûn.
- A **duergar spy** (or notes left behind by one) is investigating these deeper caverns, trying to find access to what he calls “the lost ones beneath the glacier.” Possibly mention **Xardorok Sunblight** in coded references.
- Strange sounds have been heard deeper in the mine—voices speaking a language no one recognizes, followed by the clink of metal and the tapping of tools long after the miners have left.
- Miners found chunks of black crystal embedded in the walls of a newly exposed tunnel. One miner who handled it became aggressive and paranoid before vanishing.
- A forgotten shaft was recently unsealed, and strange, precise tunnelwork was discovered—too straight, too clean. It doesn't match known dwarven or gnome mining.
- A half-scorched scrap of parchment shows a rudimentary drawing of a spiked crown and the word "DEEPKING" written in Undercommon. A scholar in Bryn Shander might recognize the title.
- A trapped duergar scout is hiding deeper in the mine, injured. He's delirious with fever and muttering about "the Chosen of the Ice Queen" and "the heart of the mountain waking."
