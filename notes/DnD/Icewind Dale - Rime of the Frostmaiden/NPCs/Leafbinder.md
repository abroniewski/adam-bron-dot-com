# Gives the characters items:

### 1. **[[Whisperbark Charm]]**
given to Kai
_Wondrous item, common_

This small pendant is made from a knot of ancient tree bark, bound with twine made of dryad hair. When worn, it grants the wearer the ability to understand the emotions of small beasts and plants in a 10-foot radius.

**While wearing this charm**, the wearer can use an action to cast _speak with animals_ or _druidcraft_, but only once per day (recharges at dawn). In addition, small creatures like squirrels, foxes, and birds are naturally curious and non-hostile toward the wearer, unless provoked.

_Druidic Flavor:_ This could be a gift from a reclusive druid after the party helps protect a grove or returns a stolen natural relic.

### 2. **[[Seed of Restful Slumber]]**
given to Myra
_Wondrous item, common (single-use)_

This tiny, smooth acorn pulses faintly with warm, earthy energy. When placed under a sleeping creature's pillow or bedroll, it ensures a peaceful and restorative sleep, even in harsh environments.

**Effect:** When used during a long rest, the user automatically succeeds on any Constitution saving throws to resist cold weather exhaustion (e.g., from _Rime of the Frostmaiden_’s environmental rules). The rest is considered protected from nightmares or minor disturbances.

_Druidic Flavor:_ Might be given to the party before they venture into a cursed or restless area—perhaps the druid says, “May the roots of the world cradle your dreams.”

### 3. **[[Gloves of Mossgrip]]**
given to Sam
_Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)_

These fingerless gloves are stitched with moss, lichen, and supple bark. While wearing them, the user gains a +1 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in natural environments (forests, tundra, mountains, etc.).

**Additionally**, the gloves grant minor climbing aid: the wearer can climb non-slick natural surfaces (trees, rocky slopes, cliff faces) without needing to make an ability check, unless the surface is particularly difficult or dangerous.

_Druidic Flavor:_ A practical gift, perhaps made by the druid themselves, intended to help the party stay hidden and mobile in the wild.


### 4. **[[Frostfern Tonic]]**
given to Emerald
_Wondrous item, common (consumable)_

This small crystal vial contains a swirling liquid the color of glacier ice, brewed from a rare fern that only grows in the shadows of ancient Evermelt groves. When consumed, the tonic grants the drinker resistance to cold damage for 10 minutes.

**In addition**, for the duration, the drinker's breath becomes visible, their skin takes on a faint bluish hue, and they leave no tracks in snow or frost.

_Druidic Flavor:_ The druid may caution the party to "drink it only when the air bites hardest," perhaps just before they ascend a mountain or delve into a tomb sealed in permafrost.
