Ythryn, later known as the Necropolis, was one of the spectacular enclaves of Netheril that soared across the skies over a millennium before the Era of Upheaval. Like nearly all of the ancient empire's flying cities, Ythryn came crashing down to Toril, remaining largely intact as a necropolis embedded deep within the heart of the Reghed Glacier in the far North of Faerûn.

The submerged ruins were regarded as little more than a tomb for the ancient Netherese, full of deadly magic awaiting anyone who sought its arcane secrets.

# Description
The enclave was formed upon a large disc, atop which sat its many odd-shaped towers and turrets, along with several shorter, domed structures. The outer rim of the disk was dotted with fourteen wizard's spires, each of which resembled a single claw reaching over the city's edge.

As with other of Netheril's enclaves, Ythryn was powered by a single [[mythallar]]. Its magic was the source of the city's flight capabilities, and could also recharge expended magic items.

# History
When Iriolarthas and his apprentices first activated the city's mythallar and elevated the city into the skies, they traveled to the region of the continent that would later be referred to as the North. They searched for long-lost magics, that dated to the ancient giant realm of Ostoria.

Finally, in the autumn of the Year of Chilled Marrow, −343 DR, the arcanists of Ythryn recovered a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils at the floor of the Sea of Moving Ice. They began experimenting upon the recovered artifact, inadvertently causing an eruption of power that disabled the enclave's [[mythallar]], and sending the flying city plummeting into the ground. During the catastrophe, a single [[wizard's spire]] broke off from the city and plunged into the tundra of Icewind Dale.

As the city crashed into the Reghed Glacier, the heat of the impact caused it to fall deeper beneath the icy surface. Once its descent was over, the Frostmaiden [[Auril]] covered the ruins in ice as a means to lay claim to the new prize. The few remaining survivors became trapped within the icy tomb; conventional means of escape were blocked by the enveloping ice, and magical means were thwarted by the lingering effects of the [[spindle]].
