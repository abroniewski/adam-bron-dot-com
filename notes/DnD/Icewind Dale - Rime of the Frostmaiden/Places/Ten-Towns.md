The Ten Towns were formed around the three lakes of [[Icewind Dale]], Redwaters, Lac Dinneshere, and Maer Dualdon.

Situated northwest of Redwaters, the smallest of the lakes, were fittingly enough the smallest villages, [[Dougan's Hole]] and [[Good Mead]]. To the north was Lac Dinneshere, upon the shores of which sat the settlements of [[Easthaven]],[[ Caer-Dineval]], and [[Caer-Konig]]. Some 10 mi (16 km) west was the largest and deepest of the lakes, Maer Dualdon, around which were situated the towns of [[Lonelywood]] (along with its namesake forest), [[Bremen]], [[Termalaine]], and the walled city of [[Targos]].

Between Lac Dinneshere and Maer Dualdon was the massive solitary peak of Kelvin's Cairn. Just south of the mountain was the Dwarven Valley, a deep chasm that housed a number of dwarf clans. 

Southwest of the valley, nestled between all three lakes, was the trading hub of [[Bryn Shander]], the gateway city that led to the rest of civilization to the south.
