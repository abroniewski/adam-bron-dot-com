_Wondrous item, common_

This small pendant is made from a knot of ancient tree bark, bound with twine made of dryad hair. When worn, it grants the wearer the ability to understand the emotions of small beasts and plants in a 10-foot radius.

**While wearing this charm**, the wearer can use an action to cast _speak with animals_ or _druidcraft_, but only once per day (recharges at dawn). In addition, small creatures like squirrels, foxes, and birds are naturally curious and non-hostile toward the wearer, unless provoked.

_Druidic Flavor:_ This could be a gift from a reclusive druid after the party helps protect a grove or returns a stolen natural relic.
