These fingerless gloves are stitched with moss, lichen, and supple bark. While wearing them, the user gains a +1 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in natural environments (forests, tundra, mountains, etc.).

**Additionally**, the gloves grant minor climbing aid: the wearer can climb non-slick natural surfaces (trees, rocky slopes, cliff faces) without needing to make an ability check, unless the surface is particularly difficult or dangerous.

_Druidic Flavor:_ A practical gift, perhaps made by the druid themselves, intended to help the party stay hidden and mobile in the wild.
