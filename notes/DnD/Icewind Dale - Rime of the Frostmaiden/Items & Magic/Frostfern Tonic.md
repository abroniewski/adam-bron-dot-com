_Wondrous item, common (consumable)_

This small crystal vial contains a swirling liquid the color of glacier ice, brewed from a rare fern that only grows in the shadows of ancient Evermelt groves. When consumed, the tonic grants the drinker resistance to cold damage for 10 minutes.

**In addition**, for the duration, the drinker's breath becomes visible, their skin takes on a faint bluish hue, and they leave no tracks in snow or frost.

_Druidic Flavor:_ The druid may caution the party to "drink it only when the air bites hardest," perhaps just before they ascend a mountain or delve into a tomb sealed in permafrost.
