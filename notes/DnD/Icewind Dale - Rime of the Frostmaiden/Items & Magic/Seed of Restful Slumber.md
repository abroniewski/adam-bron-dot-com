_Wondrous item, common (single-use)_

This tiny, smooth acorn pulses faintly with warm, earthy energy. When placed under a sleeping creature's pillow or bedroll, it ensures a peaceful and restorative sleep, even in harsh environments.

**Effect:** When used during a long rest, the user automatically succeeds on any Constitution saving throws to resist cold weather exhaustion (e.g., from _Rime of the Frostmaiden_’s environmental rules). The rest is considered protected from nightmares or minor disturbances.

_Druidic Flavor:_ Might be given to the party before they venture into a cursed or restless area—perhaps the druid says, “May the roots of the world cradle your dreams.”
