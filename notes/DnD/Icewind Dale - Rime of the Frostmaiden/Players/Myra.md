**Myra, the Lost Eladrin Bard**

Myra was born in a lush, magical land where the trees whispered ancient secrets and the rivers shimmered with the songs of the earth. The land was full of life, with vibrant flora, dancing streams, and an ever-changing cycle of seasons that brought a sense of eternal beauty. Music was as much a part of the landscape as the wind that rustled the leaves. From a young age, Myra was enchanted by the power of music to bring joy, peace, and connection to those around her. While her mother, a revered healer, worked tirelessly to soothe physical and spiritual wounds, Myra took the path of a bard, determined to spread happiness and laughter with her songs.

Her younger sister, **[[Rhynn]]**, had always been the more quiet and studious one, preferring to learn the healing arts. Rhynn’s affinity for the healing magic was almost magical in itself, and it was clear from an early age that she would follow in their mother’s footsteps, becoming a compassionate healer in her own right.

But Myra, ever the dreamer, always found herself swept away by the allure of adventure, eager to spread her music to distant lands. She spent many years traveling, performing in bustling cities and remote villages, her heart full of the joy she sought to share with others.

It was during one of these travels that Myra first met **[[Lorien]]**, a charming, enigmatic individual who came from a distant land. His eyes sparkled with mystery, and he seemed drawn to Myra’s music in a way no one else had ever been. Lorien was warm, attentive, and full of stories that made her laugh. She found herself deeply taken by him, enjoying the comfort of his presence. Over time, their relationship blossomed—Lorien was kind, attentive, and he seemed to care for her deeply. Myra’s heart, which had been hesitant to love again, softened in his presence.

When Lorien visited her homeland, he was welcomed with open arms by Myra’s family. He quickly grew close to both Myra and Rhynn, seemingly drawn to the peaceful serenity of their home. He told stories of distant lands, of cultures filled with art and music, and Myra often found herself swept up in his world of adventure. She was overjoyed to see how well he and Rhynn got along—her sister, who rarely allowed herself to fall so easily into trust, had taken to him with an openness that Myra hadn’t expected. It seemed as if he might become part of their family.

Little did Myra know, Lorien harbored a secret—a dangerous one. He was an agent of the [[Feydark Queen]], sent to spy on the court of the [[Feywild]] and, more specifically, to find a way to manipulate the magic of Myra’s homeland for his queen’s purposes. Lorien had been tasked with gaining the trust of Myra’s family and using Rhynn’s burgeoning magical abilities to gain access to the Feydark Queen’s court. As he grew closer to Rhynn, his affection for her wasn’t born out of love, but out of duty to the dark forces he served.

When Myra was away on another journey, Lorien’s manipulation reached its peak. Rhynn, trusting and kind-hearted, had grown closer to him, believing him to be a kind and gentle soul. Lorien took advantage of her trust, exploiting her abilities to gain favor with the Feydark Queen. Myra was happy for her sister, thinking that Rhynn had finally found someone who truly understood her. She never suspected that Lorien’s true intentions were darker than she could have imagined.

The turning point came when Lorien made his move—using Rhynn’s magic to open a portal to the Feydark, allowing the Queen’s agents to slip into their world unnoticed. The betrayal was swift, and Rhynn, trusting Lorien until the very end, was caught off guard. Myra returned home to find her land, once lush and vibrant, now decimated. The magic that once flowed freely had been stolen. The once-joyous world was now a shadow of its former self, and the air was thick with the absence of the magic that had once held it all together.

In the center of it all, Myra found her sister, Rhynn, paralyzed and broken, unable to move or speak, her heart shattered by the betrayal of the one she had loved. Myra’s own heart broke when she realized that Rhynn’s magic had been drained, and that her sister’s ability to dance—the one thing she loved most—was lost forever. The betrayal stung deeper because Myra had once been so happy to see Rhynn and Lorien so close. She had believed in the goodness of the relationship, never suspecting that it had all been a lie.

**[[Aerin]]**, Myra’s older brother, had left when she was still a child, chasing his own destiny in the world. His departure had left a hole in Myra’s heart, and despite the years, she never stopped thinking about him. He was an enigmatic figure in her memories—brave, kind, and full of potential. Myra holds onto the hope that one day, he will return, and when he does, perhaps he will be the key to saving Rhynn and their home.

Aerin’s absence only intensified Myra’s sense of loss, and with it, her need to protect the ones she loved. She never told anyone about her brother, holding his memory close as a secret that no one else seemed to remember.

Now, Myra is a changed person. Her heart is still filled with love, but she no longer trusts easily. She carries the heavy burden of betrayal in her chest, and the once carefree music that flowed from her is now tinged with sorrow and longing. Myra still longs to restore her homeland, heal her sister, and bring back the magic that was stolen. But she knows she cannot do it alone.

Her feelings for Lorien remain complicated. He was the first person she truly allowed herself to love in years, and the pain of his betrayal is something she cannot simply let go of. Does she still love him? Is there a part of her that hopes he will come back, apologizing, or is it just the memory of the warmth he once showed her that lingers? Regardless, Myra knows she cannot dwell on the past, for her sister’s future is at stake.

Myra's sister is being held hostage. By the feydark.
