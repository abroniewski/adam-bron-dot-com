# Sammath Naur
*(Formerly known as Narvinye Telemnar)*

## The Fire That Changed Everything
Narvinye Telemnar—now known as [[Sammath Naur]]—once lived a peaceful life in the serene forests of [[Eryndor]]. Born the only child of [[Elendil Telemnar]] and [[Elaria Telemnar]], his family was known for their enchanting and blade-smithing. His father’s enchanted blade—a treasured heirloom—was passed down through generations of Bladesingers.

One fateful night, a malevolent [[Fire Djinn]] razed his home. Narvinye awoke to screams as his parents were trapped in the blaze. Though his hands burned with an uncontrollable fire, he witnessed the Djinn’s cruel laughter before it vanished in the embers.

## A New Identity
Haunted by whispers—“Did the boy summon the Djinn? Did he destroy his own family?”—Narvinye fled his ruined home. In the wilderness he found a wounded elf boy named [[Sammath Naur (the original)]]. Using a black-market memory‑wipe potion, he erased the boy’s memories and stole his identity. With the boy’s admission papers to [[Strixhaven University]] in hand, he set off for the big city—hoping to bury his past. But guilt and the fear that the real Sammath might someday regain his memories haunt him still.

## Life at Strixhaven
At Strixhaven, Sam threw himself into his studies, determined to become the top wizard. His unusual fire spells—perhaps linked to that long-ago Djinn—set him apart. While he trained in both wizardry and [[Bladesinging]], he also wielded his father’s blade as a promise to avenge his parents and prove his worth.

## The Dean’s Blackmail
In his third year, [[Uvilda Mistcoiler]] (the Dean of Perfection at Prismari College) discovered his secret forged admission. Threatening expulsion unless he retrieved a rare crystal to restore the university’s dwindling power, Sam was forced into a dangerous task that only deepened his paranoia. Now fragments of the original Sammath’s memories begin to surface.

## A Fire Within
Torn between his stolen past and a destiny forged in flame, Sam’s quest to master fire and magic becomes inseparable from his quest for truth. With his father’s blade in hand, he is determined to prove not only to himself but also to [[Uvilda Mistcoiler]] and the world that he truly belongs.

## Echoes of the Weave – 3rd day of Ches, 1492 DR (03-03-2024)

Today our newly formed team—including a half‑orc tracker named Kairn Barret, [[Myra]], and [[Kai|Kaiden Blackthorn]] (yes, the same Kaiden from Prismari)—set out with [[Ilyana ]] to locate a long‑lost vault tied to the cataclysm that reshaped our world. 

The mission was explained in detail: uncover the history of the cataclysm, secure a mysterious crystal core, and return it to the Arcanum. Shortly after setting off, we were ambushed by raiders and monstrous crystalline beasts. In the chaos, our bonds were tested, and long‑hidden resentments and alliances surfaced.

## Echoes of the Weave – 8th day of Alturiak, 1492 DR (08-02-2024)
Today, I began my 3rd year at [[Strixhaven University]] as a student of Prismari College. I was called into [[Uvilda Mistcoiler]]’s office—a moment that had me on edge. The Genasi arranged a 3rd‑year internship for me and sent me to meet a mysterious woman named [[Ilyana]] in the desolated deserts of the Shattered Expanse. 

I am both excited and fearful for what this quest may entail. The crystal that might restore magic to Strixhaven is at stake—and I can’t help but wonder if this task might unlock a new power within me, or even help me master the fire that has both cursed and defined me.

## Echoes of the Weave – 10th day of Tarsakh, 1492 DR (10-04-2024)
After surviving the vault’s trials, our crew found ourselves tasked with the next step: finding the Crystaline Chamber. Along the way, we encountered reinforcements—an old dwarf named [[Oskar Durthane]], a grumpy warlock called Alex, and first‑year druid [[Emerald]]. 

The chamber presented new puzzles and dangers: beams of light, shifting panels, and a mechanism that summoned a giant crystalline scorpion. Amid the chaos, our alliances shifted and our resolve was tested. I clutched the crystal fragment from [[Johnny]] as its power pulsed through me—reminding me of the day my parents perished at the hands of that infernal fire.

## Echoes of the Weave – 30th Day of Mirtul, 1492 DR (30-05-2024)
The balance of our group was again threatened by a massive crystalline scorpion, its body crawling with hatchlings. While Emerald struggled to free her pet squirrel Smokey from a trapped scale, I engaged the beast with my trusty scimitar and Bladesong technique. 

The battle was fierce and the stakes—both personal and for our mission—never felt higher. Every swing of my blade, every burst of flame was a reminder of the inferno that stole my childhood. In the heat of combat, we were forced to confront not just the creature, but our own inner fears and past regrets.
## Icewind Dale Rime of the Frostmaiden – 1st Day of Urtak, 1492 DR (01-11-2024)
In the midst of battling the crystalline scorpion, a voice echoed—declaring, “Enough!” The vault’s construct transported us to a white void, imparting cryptic knowledge of a new region: Icewind Dale, a land gripped by eternal winter under the curse of [[Auril]]. 

Armed with a magically manifested winter coat and an unexpected map of Icewind Dale, I lead our party (albeit reluctantly, with Emerald’s squirrel Smokey serving as an impromptu scarf) into this frozen realm. Soon we arrived in the town of Dougan’s Hole, where a local named [[Danika]] explained the presence of mischievous elemental beings—[[Chwinga]]—and mentioned grim rumors of human sacrifices during the new moon.

## Icewind Dale Rime of the Frostmaiden – 21st Day of Uktar, 1492 DR (21-11-2024)
The stakes were raised today when our party advanced into a Frost Giant’s ice castle. Paranoia, visions of fire, and the weight of past tragedies—especially the fear that I might repeat my parents’ fate—made every step treacherous. 

Inside the castle, as we encountered echoes of our past and fought against a rampaging mammoth (named [[Norsu]]), our bonds were tested. Kai suffered injuries and the creature’s grief underscored the bitter cost of ancient loss. In the midst of chaos, I found myself forced to reconcile my ambition with my deep-seated fears.

# Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden – 27th Day of Nightal, 1492 DR (27-12-2024)

After watching Norsu depart with the wolves [[Corryn]] and [[Kanin]], we heard the plaintive cries of children trapped behind an icy wall. Venturing into a musty chamber with dark, foul odors (reminiscent of a [[Remorhaz]]’s lair), we discovered kidnapped children and clashed with a band of mischievous kobolds ([[Zilbo]], [[Snorb]], and [[Holgy]]).

The tension among our group escalated—especially with Kai’s reckless behavior—yet we managed to free the children and broker an uneasy peace with Norsu. Later, personal conflicts reached a boiling point when I confronted Kai about his impulsiveness, leaving me with a heavy heart and unresolved emotions.
