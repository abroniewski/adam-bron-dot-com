## Background Story

Prince, running away to prevent becoming king/ part of a fucked court. 

Flooded library  
Grandmother ([[Maeve]]) sent Kai on this adventure to figure out what to do to break the curse on his father. She orchestrated with [[Strixhaven University]] the trip.  
[[Father]] found a dark item and Kai is no longer safe. Father is becoming a tyrant. 

He has an older sister, younger brother died. Was Kai’s fault. 

Kai has a temper and less control of his magic than he wants. Anger management and impulse control. Little brother ([[Rowan]])  was very sick, Kai got no attention as a child. Bitter. Older sister ([[Lysandra]]) picked on Kai. 

Relationship with [[Sam]]: projection of little brother. Want to keep him safe. Envy because Sam is so controlled. Do think he needs to let go sometimes. Afraid seeking power will end up destroying or changing the goodness in Sam.
