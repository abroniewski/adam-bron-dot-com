# Journal
## **30th day of Hammer, 1492 DR**

Zagnar, the mummy we have just awakened and who politely introduced himself upon seeing us, smells unexpectedly… like cinnamon. _I don’t know what I expected mummies to smell like, but it wasn’t like a hot beverage on a rainy day while the leaves turn red._

He’s very eager to please us and answer all of our questions. I don’t know if it’s according to social etiquette to ask someone how they died, but anyway, he’s happy to tell us that he was one part of the **Elvandar druidic trio**, and that he had found power to bring harmony to this area. But then he was **betrayed by the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]**, who stabbed him, possibly literally, in the back.

There was something about the **Frost Maiden [[Auril]] sending [[Frost Druids]] and duergar to find [[Chardalyn]] in this area**, but I’m not sure if that was before or after he died. I was more focused on him uttering the word **“druid.”** _Druids, like me, but… frosty?_

- **"Yes, you are a druid,"** [[Sam]] says.
- **"You’ll get there,"** [[Kai]] says, _demoting me._

Kai has officially crossed over to the group of people who no longer hold my esteem. **He’s right down there with the dwarves.**

---

Anyhow, **Zagnar the eager, cinnamon-scented mummy** looks into my soul. It feels like I have a **bad itch**.

**Lots of memories come up, memories I have tried to block from my mind.**

- **People slaughtered with axes while asleep in their beds.**
- **So many terrible screams…**

I need a **smoke** so bad.
#### **Elbowing Kai Aside – The Truth About [[Smokey]]**

I elbow Kai out of the way and ask the question that has been pressing on me since the day I saved him from that wolf:

**"Is Smokey really a squirrel?"**

The mirror shimmers. It shows us a scene in a forest.  
An old druid sits on a log, feeding squirrels.  
Another man arrives. They embrace, but then the newcomer **whacks him on the head**.  
The old druid falls down and **transforms into a squirrel**.

The mirror speaks: **"Yes, Smokey is a squirrel."**

Oh no. Smokey…

But there's no time to think about all the weird things I just saw—about Sam, about Kai’s enemy, about Smokey’s curse, and possibly [[Myra]]’s sister, and Sam’s **travel itinerary to Auril’s castle**.

---

#### **Myra’s Call for Help**

Myra’s voice, calling for help, rings in our ears.

**"Fuck!"** Sam shouts, and he storms toward the tomb of the half-moon she was eager to loot. Kai and I follow, and we see Myra inside a **moonbeam**, facing a **bad-tempered druid**.

Sam throws four daggers at her—to no avail.  
Kai aims his **fire orb**—but misses.

While running, **I transform into a wolf** (_because I’m a real druid, not just "getting there"!_), leap over Sam and Kai, and charge through the **moonbeam** (_ouch_), landing on top of the **frost druid**.

I try to bite her neck, but she dodges and scrambles to her feet.  
Snapping her fingers, she **instantly summons eight wolves**.

**Eh… fuck.**

_"Let’s play, shall we?"_ she says.

---

#### **The Mirror’s Revelation – The Real Sam?**

I ask the mirror:

**"Is the real Sam coming after me?"**

**WHAT?!**

I mean. **WHAT?**

**Is Sam not Sam?**

The mirror shows **Sam / Not Sam** curled up into a ball, wearing rags, begging for money in an alley.

Then, the mirror speaks:

**"Not Sam. Sam is not coming after you."**

**What?**  
**How?**  
**What?**

Sam **squeezes my hand** really hard, and I know I have to hurry—**my moonbeam is ticking away**.

Just as I open my mouth, I hear Kai’s voice:

**"How will I defeat him?"**

That **son of a dwarf**. How long has he been standing there?!  
And **he stole my question time slot.**

---

#### **The Throne and the Gem**

The mirror **wavers**. Suddenly, we see a **castle**.

On the throne sits a **[[tiefling]]**, wearing a **crown** and a **disinterested** look on his face. He holds a **scepter with a giant chardalyn gem**.

**Who the fuck is this guy, then?**

The mirror speaks:

**"Break the [[gem]] and break the curse."**

Enough of this. **There are only seconds left.**

---

#### **Can I Ever Go Home?**

Anyway, **my moonbeam is lit!** Literally and figuratively.

I focus on one **half-moon** so Kai can loot his tomb, then the other **half-moon** so Myra can loot hers, then the **full moon**. Once I master my focus, I follow Sam to the mirror.

**I told you—I am a druid.**

Just as I arrive, Sam asks the mirror:

**"Where can we find Auril?"**

The mirror **zooms in** on a landscape—an **icy mountain** that looks like a skull. Inside, we see a **flash of a throne room**.

_Does Sam want to go there?_ Well, no time for pondering.

It’s **my turn to ask a question**, and **time is running out**.

**"Can I ever go home?"** I say.

The mirror shows me:

- A **woman with feathers and beads in her hair**.
- Then, **myself, gathering herbs in a frozen landscape**.
- **Green and nature radiates** out of me, as if **I am the center of it all**.

The **mirror me** pours something into a bowl and **feeds it to a young girl who looks a lot like Myra**.

The mirror speaks:

**"Follow the [[Leafbinder]], master your craft, bring true balance, and help those in need. Only you decide if you go home."**

Oh my Gods.

**This is too much information.**

How do I even…

Sam **grasps my hand** and quickly says:

**"Sorry, Emerald. Please don’t tell."**

Then he turns to the mirror.

---

#### **The White Moose and Chardalyn**

Kai gestures to me to hand him something, and because **we can’t speak**, I just **hope he means my little bowl of valerian root** and not, say, my underwear.

Kai takes the **ground valerian root**, puts it right under the snout of the **white moose**.

Its **head drops**—clearly unconscious now.

**That was easy.**

I spot something **shiny in the antlers of the white moose**.

**It's chardalyn.**

_Is this what caused the animal to act so unnaturally?_

I think it must be. I **pop out five pieces** (and give one to my team, later on).

_Keeping two for myself._

**What did Zagnar say about chardalyn again?**

I **don’t remember**, but it was **important**.

---

#### **The Mirror and the Full Moon**

Kai leaves (_don’t know where_), so I just **wake up one of the sleeping goats** to see if it’s cursed.

It **wakes up, sits there, and kinda looks around**.

Okay. **Not cursed then.**

The others return and drag me outside.

They found the mirror, but it **didn’t answer any questions**.

Zagnar says we **have to wait until the full moon in 7 days**.

But suddenly, **I remember I can cast a moonbeam**!

**Theoretically.** I don’t think I’ve tried it before, but **I AM a druid**, not just "getting there."

I go to the **moon dial** to focus my **moonbeam** on the **full moon**, while Kai and Myra say they want to loot the two **half-moon tombs**.

Fine. **Half-moon. Other half-moon. Full moon.**

---

#### **Final Thoughts**

Our plan involves **a lot of shouting** around Myra’s **silence spell** and seems **unnecessarily complicated**.

---

#### **Zagnar’s Words and the Silence Spell**

Zagnar tells me:

**"The path of the druid is the path of balance, of accountability. You’re on the right path."**

Huh. Go figure.

**"What do you want me to do?"** he asks next.

We kinda invite him to **hang out with us** while we **search for a mirror that answers 7 questions**.

Zagnar says we can find it inside **the hill that Kai desecrated**.

Great.

There are **lots of animals inside the hill**, all asleep, so we **don’t want to wake them up**.

**Problem:**  
Kai—who’s **known for shouting “ECHO, ECHO” inside a frost giant’s lair and bitch-slapping kobolds for no reason**—will be with us.

**We just know he’s going to mess this up.**

**"Why don’t you stop trembling?"** he scoffs.

I suggest **Tiira conjures his silence spell around him**, and he **throws a pinecone at me**.

Effectively proving my suggestion **valid.**

Tiira **casts silence** inside the hill so that even if Kai **starts singing a sudden ballad**, nobody—**and certainly not the animals**—will hear him.

We **climb into the hill** through Kai’s hole (_ugh_), and Sam and Tiira immediately **sprint toward the mirror**, barely paying attention to the fact that:

- The **white moose I dreamed about**…
- The one that **has been murdering loggers**…
- Is **asleep inside this cave**.

Just goes to show **how badly Myra and Sam want to keep the people of Icewind Dale safe**.

Now, it’s up to **me and Kai** to deal with this…
