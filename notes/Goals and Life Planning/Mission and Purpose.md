- Focus on the other people and environment. Must be set in the world we act and live in
- Instead of SELF-cantered M&P, it should be targeted on the world around us, the space in which we operate. 
- E.g. as interviewee: "Help the employer see and decide that I am a person of great character and integrity that the employers company just have to take the business to the next level"
- Can have 1 for different levels of abstraction (high level for life, low level for specific event or short term time period)
- Can change over time as external factors change. 

# Don't try to control outcome, focus on process
- Set goals we can control
	- This means controlling myself; influencing my behaviour and activity. 
- Everything outside of our own habits and actions, all results and outcomes, can be thought of as "acts of god". 
- If we want results, we need to identify the habits and behaviours required (ie the things we can control) to attain that result. 

We can control our goals, but the objectives are outside of our control. Only make your goals related to your behaviours. 
### Goal
1. focus on mission and purpose
2. Control neediness (never demonstrate it)
3. always allow the other side of negotiation to feel ok 
4. No fear of saying or hearing "No"
