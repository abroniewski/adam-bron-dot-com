# Vision for 2025

I live a life driven by growth, vulnerability, and intention. I am focused on building a sustainable foundation in my career, strengthening relationships, prioritizing health, and experiencing joy in the present moment. My goals align with my values, support my personal commandments, and integrate internal KPIs to measure success without external comparison.

# Guiding Philosophy

_I value personal growth above all else. I grow through my willingness to be vulnerable._

# Health

_I am in a physical condition that allows me to enjoy my favourite physical activities without injury or pain, and I can be competitive in any "random" physical activity. My health activities are focused on injury prevention and long-term health._

•      Physical Activity – Move your body with intention 3 times every week
	◦       Gym: Perform resistance training targeting main muscle groups (3-4 exercises).
	◦       Sports: Squash?
	◦       Outdoor Activities: Go hiking or take a nature walk once per month.
•      Food – Fast in the morning and eat intentionally.
	◦       Plan meals every weekend and meal prep a main focal aspect (e.g. chicken).
	◦       Keep meals simple, repeat what works.
	◦       Don't let food go to waste.

◦       Portion out candy/ sweets before eating.

•      Sleep – Stay consistent and use wind down routine before bed.

◦       Be in bed by **11:30 PM** on weekdays.

**Adams commandments**

1.             Honour your sleep. Everything is easier when you sleep enough.

2.             You thrive in structure. Plan your time, have a purpose in what you do.

3.             Acknowledge your feelings right away and process them at some point through prayer, journaling and talking to others.

4.             Discipline brings joy - follow through on commitments to self. Your mind knows what you need when you are planning ahead.

5.             Have genuine gratitude for the things that are good in your life.

6.             Smile. Force it. Only after processing your feelings.

7.             Drink water - your cravings for food and sweet are driven by thirst
