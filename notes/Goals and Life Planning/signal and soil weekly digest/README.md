## Purpose
This is a weekly personal radar, not a news dump.

Core question:
**What is happening around me that aligns with who I am and who I am becoming?**

## Cadence
- Weekly, Monday morning.
- Reading time target: 6 to 8 minutes.
- Quality first.

## Four macro categories

### 1) Stability
Low noise, high signal, behaviour-changing only.

Include only if action-relevant:
- Sleep science worth implementing
- Practical ADHD executive-function tactics
- Burnout recovery research (including partner support)
- Dopamine regulation insights
- Financial policy shifts only if decision-relevant
- Eindhoven housing movements only if material

Output shape:
- 3 to 5 bullets max
- If no behavioural impact, exclude

### 2) Leverage
Professional edge and influence advantage.

Focus on:
- Enterprise buying psychology
- Negotiation patterns
- Sales cycle acceleration
- Executive storytelling
- Multi-threading enterprise deals
- Stakeholder mapping
- Communication clarity upgrades

Output shape:
- 4 bullets + 1 practical weekly experiment

### 3) Connection
Relationship, community, and theatre ecosystem.

Focus on:
- Brabant arts funding deadlines
- Community theatre case studies
- Local partnership initiatives
- Relationship research insights
- Communication repair frameworks
- Long-term marriage psychology

Output shape:
- 3 to 4 bullets

### 4) Aliveness
Geo-aware, identity-aligned event radar.

A) Eindhoven + nearby event radar
- TicketSwap
- Muziekgebouw Eindhoven
- Effenaar
- Parktheater
- Dynamo
- Local improv/theatre workshops
- Fly-fishing clubs in Brabant
- DJ nights and cultural festivals

Filter by fit:
- Genres and scenes that feel like Adam
- Acting/theatre/improv
- Creative workshops
- Outdoor/nature
- Weird/experimental wildcard picks

B) Spotify artist tour tracker
- Track liked/frequent artists and genre gravity
- Alert for Netherlands, Belgium, Western Germany
- Travel radius: 2.5 hours

Output shape:
- 5 events in Eindhoven region
- 1 Spotify tour update
- 1 wildcard slightly outside current norm

## Writing format
- Plain, easy English
- Low jargon
- Every bullet ends with one of:
  - **Why this matters:**
  - **Possible action:**
  - **Ignore unless:**

## Source policy
- Freshness-first by default
- Expand watchlist continuously from high-signal references
- Prefer synthesis over list-format linking

## File conventions
- One note per week: `YYYY-Www.md`
- Store all issues in this folder
- Keep non-public by default unless explicitly requested
