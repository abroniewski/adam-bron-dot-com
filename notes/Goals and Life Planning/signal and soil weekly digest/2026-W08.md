excerpt: Weekly personal radar across Stability, Leverage, Connection, and Aliveness with Eindhoven-aware signal tracking.
---

## Summary
- This week’s strongest personal signal is not “do more”. It is “protect energy so the right work compounds”.
- In work, your advantage this week comes from sharper deal diagnostics and clearer executive framing, not more activity.
- In connection, small reliability beats big gestures. One or two deliberate actions will move more than broad intentions.
- In aliveness, there are solid Eindhoven options, but the best picks are the ones that feel identity-aligned, not just available.

## Stability
- Your sleep baseline still looks like the highest-leverage life system. **Possible action:** lock one non-negotiable shutdown trigger tonight (for example: screens off at 22:00).
- ADHD and executive-function tactics work best when tied to one visible cue, not abstract plans. **Possible action:** put tomorrow’s Top 3 on one sticky note before bed.
- Burnout prevention in close relationships is mostly about reducing invisible load and uncertainty. **Possible action:** do one 10-minute check-in with Beata focused on “what would make this week lighter?”.
- Dopamine management is strongest when you reduce context switching, not when you chase motivation. **Ignore unless:** you notice repeated task-hopping and late-evening over-stimulation.

## Leverage
- Enterprise buyers are asking for speed with control, not speed alone. **Why this matters:** your pitch should pair impact with risk management in the same sentence.
- Multi-threading is still a major edge in complex deals. **Possible action:** map one additional stakeholder in your next active opportunity this week.
- Better discovery questions often beat better slides. **Possible action:** ask one diagnostic question early: “What would make this initiative fail internally even if the tool works technically?”
- Executive storytelling lands better when it follows one line: pressure -> decision -> outcome. **Why this matters:** this structure makes your message easier to repeat inside client organisations.

### Weekly experiment
- In your next call, test this sequence once: (1) pressure, (2) bottleneck, (3) measurable outcome target. **Possible action:** write those 3 prompts before the call and stick to them.

## Connection
- ITCE/community work is strongest when tied to specific next commitments, not general enthusiasm. **Possible action:** leave every meeting with one owner, one date, one deliverable.
- Relationship quality compounds through repair speed, not conflict avoidance. **Possible action:** if tension appears this week, run a short repair loop within 24 hours.
- Network depth grows from repeated small touches. **Possible action:** send two short follow-up messages this week to people you want to build with.

## Aliveness

### Eindhoven and nearby events
- Muziekgebouw Eindhoven has multiple spring concerts already visible, including classical and live-band options. **Why this matters:** easy way to pre-book one high-quality evening now instead of deciding last minute. Source: https://mge.nl/en/agenda/
- Effenaar agenda currently shows strong activity across indie, heavy, pop/rock, and dance categories. **Possible action:** pick one genre-lane for this week, not five. Source: https://www.effenaar.nl/agenda
- Parktheater agenda is available but web extraction is noisy due cookie and page rendering layers. **Ignore unless:** you want me to manually shortlist 2-3 theatre options from the live site view next pass. Source: https://www.parktheater.nl/agenda
- Dynamo agenda path changed and one endpoint now returns 404, so source mapping needs an update in the watcher. **Possible action:** swap to their current events endpoint before next week’s run. Source: https://www.dynamo-eindhoven.nl
- TicketSwap remains the best flexibility channel when plans are fluid. **Why this matters:** lets you commit late without defaulting to staying in. Source: https://www.ticketswap.com

### Spotify tour tracker
- Tour-tracker integration is not yet wired to your actual liked artists list. **Possible action:** next setup step is to define your top artist seed list so alerts can be relevance-scored.

### Wildcard
- Choose one event this week that is slightly outside your norm but still identity-aligned (for example experimental live set, improv, or creative workshop). **Possible action:** decide by Wednesday, not Friday.
