## Summary
- Protect sleep and attention first. It is the foundation for everything else this week.
- Your work edge is clarity in conversations, not volume of activity.
- In relationships and community, small consistent repair and follow-up actions will outperform big intentions.
- For aliveness, pick one event that feels deeply “you”, plus one wildcard that stretches you a little.

## Stability
- Keep one hard evening boundary this week: no new work after your shutdown time. This is the simplest way to protect sleep quality and next-day focus ([Huberman Lab](https://www.hubermanlab.com), [James Clear on habits](https://jamesclear.com/articles)). **Possible action:** set one recurring 22:00 shutdown alarm.
- For ADHD-style executive function, external cues beat willpower. Visible prompts reduce decision friction ([ADDitude](https://www.additudemag.com), [Russell Barkley resources](https://www.russellbarkley.org)). **Possible action:** write tomorrow’s Top 3 before bed and place it where you work.
- Partner burnout support works best when stress is made explicit, not assumed ([Relate](https://www.relate.org.uk), [Gottman Institute](https://www.gottman.com/blog/)). **Possible action:** run one 10-minute weekly check-in with Beata on “what would make this week lighter?”.

## Leverage
- In enterprise deals, start with the problem language of the buyer, not your solution language. This increases trust and speeds qualification ([Simon Sinek](https://simonsinek.com), [HBR](https://hbr.org)). **Why this matters:** buyers support people who understand their pressure.
- Ask one better diagnostic question early: “What will block this internally even if the tool works?” This surfaces hidden politics and budget constraints ([Gong Labs](https://www.gong.io/blog/), [Winning by Design](https://www.winningbydesign.com/resources/)). **Possible action:** use this exact question in your next call.
- Keep message structure simple: pressure -> decision -> outcome. Executives remember this better than feature lists ([McKinsey Insights](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights), [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog)). **Why this matters:** your message travels further inside the client.
- Use leverage systems, not only effort. Small reusable routines compound over time ([Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog), [The Practice by Seth Godin](https://seths.blog)). **Ignore unless:** your week is already over-optimised and rigid.

### Weekly experiment
- Before one key meeting, prepare 3 lines only: the pressure they feel, the decision they must make, and the measurable outcome they care about. **Possible action:** test this once and compare meeting quality.

## Connection
- Vulnerability with boundaries builds trust faster than polished performance ([Brené Brown](https://brenebrown.com)). **Possible action:** share one honest “where I’m at” update with someone close this week.
- Relationship quality improves through quick repair after tension, not by avoiding hard moments ([Gottman Institute](https://www.gottman.com/blog/)). **Possible action:** if friction appears, close the loop within 24 hours.
- For ITCE and local ecosystem building, progress comes from concrete commitments (owner + date + deliverable), not open-ended enthusiasm ([Kunstloc Brabant](https://www.kunstlocbrabant.nl), [Gemeente Eindhoven](https://www.eindhoven.nl)). **Why this matters:** it turns goodwill into momentum.

## Aliveness

### Eindhoven and nearby events
- **Effenaar** has broad genre coverage right now, useful for picking one music night that fits your taste ([Effenaar agenda](https://www.effenaar.nl/agenda)). **Possible action:** shortlist one date by Wednesday.
- **Muziekgebouw Eindhoven** has strong upcoming live options, including concerts that can work as intentional reset evenings ([Muziekgebouw agenda](https://mge.nl/en/agenda/)). **Why this matters:** pre-booking protects your week from defaulting to work.
- **Parktheater** remains a strong theatre/culture lane for depth and inspiration ([Parktheater agenda](https://www.parktheater.nl/agenda)). **Ignore unless:** your week already has two evening commitments.
- **TicketSwap** is your flexibility valve when you want optionality without overcommitting ([TicketSwap](https://www.ticketswap.com)). **Possible action:** set one alert for an event you would genuinely regret missing.
- **This is Eindhoven events** is useful for discovering smaller local and experimental events ([This is Eindhoven events](https://www.thisiseindhoven.com/en/events)). **Why this matters:** better signal for “this feels like Adam” than generic listings.

### Spotify tour tracker
- Add a starter list of your top 20 artists so we can track tours in NL/BE/Western DE using Songkick and Bandsintown ([Songkick](https://www.songkick.com), [Bandsintown](https://www.bandsintown.com)). **Possible action:** send me your first 10 artists and I’ll seed the tracker.

### Wildcard
- Pick one event slightly outside your usual pattern this week, ideally creative or experimental, so aliveness includes novelty not just comfort ([This is Eindhoven events](https://www.thisiseindhoven.com/en/events)). **Possible action:** choose one wildcard by Thursday.
